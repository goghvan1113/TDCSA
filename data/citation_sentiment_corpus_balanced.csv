"Among these advances, forest-based modeling (Mi et al., 2008; Mi and Huang, 2008) and tree sequence-based modeling (Liu et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2008a) are two interesting modeling methods with promising results reported.",1,original
"The fluency models hold promise for actual improvements in machine translation output quality (Zwarts and Dras, 2008).",1,original
"This approach took inspiration from the pioneering work by (Dolan 1994), but it is also fundamentally different, because instead of grouping similar senses together, the CoreLex approach groups together words according to all of their senses.",1,original
"Lins (1998) information-theoretic similarity measure is commonly used in lexicon acquisition tasks and has demonstrated good performance in unsupervised WSD (McCarthy et al., 2004).",1,original
"Point-wise mutual information (Lin, 1998) and Relative Feature Focus (Geffet and Dagan, 2004) are well-known examples.",1,original
"4.1 Features We used a dependency structure as the context for words because it is the most widely used and one of the best performing contextual information in the past studies (Ruge, 1997; Lin, 1998).",1,original
"Among these measures, the most important are Wu & Palmers (Wu and Palmer, 1994), Resniks (Resnik, 1995) and Lins (Lin, 1998).",1,original
One of the most important is Lins (1998).,1,original
Erk (2007) compared a number of techniques for creating similar-word sets and found that both the Jaccard coefficient and Lin (1998a)s information-theoretic metric work best.,1,original
"This similarity score is computed as a max over a number of component scoring functions, some based on external lexical resources, including:  various string similarity functions, of which most are applied to word lemmas  measures of synonymy, hypernymy, antonymy, and semantic relatedness, including a widelyused measure due to Jiang and Conrath (1997), based on manually constructed lexical resources such as WordNet and NomBank  a function based on the well-known distributional similarity metric of Lin (1998), which automatically infers similarity of words and phrases from their distributions in a very large corpus of English text The ability to leverage external lexical resources both manually and automatically constructedis critical to the success of MANLI.",1,original
"Whereas dependency based semantic spaces have been shown to surpass other word space models for a number of problems (Pad and Lapata, 2007; Lin, 1998), for the task of categorisation simple pattern based spaces have been shown to perform equally good if not better (Poesio and Almuhareb, 2005b; Almuhareb and Poesio, 2005b).",1,original

"WSD is one of the fundamental problems in natural language processing and is important for applications such as machine translation (MT) (Chan et al., 2007a; Carpuat and Wu, 2007), information retrieval (IR), etc. WSD is typically viewed as a classification problem where each ambiguous word is assigned a sense label (from a pre-defined sense inventory) during the disambiguation process.",1,original
"There has been considerable skepticism over whether WSD will actually improve performance of applications, but we are now starting to see improvement in performance due to WSD in cross-lingual information retrieval (Clough and Stevenson, 2004; Vossen et al., 2006) and machine translation (Carpuat and Wu, 2007; Chan et al., 2007) and we hope that other applications such as question-answering, text simplication and summarisation might also benet as WSD methods improve.",1,original

"On the other hand, integrating an additional component into a baseline SMT system is notoriously tricky as evident in the research on integrating word sense disambiguation (WSD) into SMT systems: different ways of integration lead to conflicting conclusions on whether WSD helps MT performance (Chan et al., 2007; Carpuat and Wu, 2007).",1,original
"In Statistical Machine Translation (SMT), recent work shows that WSD helps translation quality when the WSD system directly uses translation candidates as sense inventories (Carpuat and Wu, 2007; Chan et al., 2007; Gimenez and M`arquez, 2007).",1,original

all sentences m the DSO corpus m which a word is tagged with sense 0 or -1 (A word is tagged with sense 0 or -1 ff none of the given senses m WoRDNFT applies ) 4, sentence from Semcor is considered to

on the intersected corpus is not high, we would like to find out how the agreement rate would be affected if different sense classes were in use In this section, we present a greedy search algorithm that can automatmalb derive coarser sense classes based on the sense tags assigned by two human annotators The resulting derived coarse sense classes achmve a higher agreement rate but we still maintain as many of the original sense classes as possible The algorithm is given m Figure 1 The algorithm operates on a set of sentences where each sentence contains an occurrence of the word w whmh has been sense-tagged by two human annotators At each Iteration of the algorithm, tt finds the pair of sense classes Ct and Cj such that merging these two sense classes results in the highest t~ value for the resulting merged group of sense classes It then proceeds to merge Cz and C~ Thin process Is repeated until the ~ value reaches a satisfactory value ~,~t,~, which we set as 0 8 Note that this algorithm is also applicable to deriving any coarser set of classes from a refined set for any NLP tasks in which prior human agreement rate may not be high enough Such NLP tasks could be discourse tagging, speech-act categorization, etc 6 Results For each word w from the list of 121 nouns and 70 verbs, ~e applied the greedy search algorithm to each set of sentences in the intersected corpus contaming w For a subset of 95 words (53 nouns and 42 verbs), the algorithm was able to derive a coarser set of 2 or more senses for each of these 95 words such that the resulting Kappa ~alue reaches 0 8 or higher For the other 96 words, m order for the Kappa value to reach 0 8 or higher, the algorithm collapses all senses of the ~ord to a single (trivial) class Table 2 and 3 summarizes the results for the set of 53 nouns and 42 ~erbs, respectively Table 2 md~cates that before the collapse of sense classes, these 53 nouns have an average of 7 6 senses per noun There is a total of 5,339 sentences in the intersected corpus containing these nouns, of which 3,387 sentences were assigned the same sense by the two groups of human annotators The average Kappa statistic (computed as a simple average of the Kappa statistic of ~he mdlwdual nouns) is 0 463 After the collapse of sense classes by the greedy search algorithm, the average number of senses per noun for these 53 nouns drops to 40 Howe~er, the number of sentences which have been asmgned the same coarse sense by the annotators increases to 5,033 That is, about 94 3% of the sentences have been assigned the same coarse sense, and that the average Kappa statistic has improved to 0 862, mgmfymg high rater-annotator agreement on the derived coarse senses Table3 gl~es the analogous figures for the 42 verbs, agmn mdmatmg that high agreement is achieved on the coarse sense classes den~ed for verbs 7 Discussion Our findings on rater-annotator agreement for word sense tagging indicate that for average language users, it is quite dl~cult to achieve high agreement when they are asked to assign refned sense tags (such as those found in WORDNET) given only the scanty definition entries m the WORDNET dlctionary and a few or no example sentences for the usage of each word sense Thin observation agrees wlth that obtmned m a recent study done by (Veroms, 1998), where the agreement on sense-tagging by naive users was also not hlgh Thus It appears that an average language user is able to process language wlthout needing to perform the task of dlsamblguatmg word sense to a very fine-grained resolutmn as formulated m a tradltlonal dmtlonary In contrast, expert lexicographers tagged the ~ ord sense in the sentences used m the SENSEVAL exerclse, where high rater-annotator agreement was reported There are also fuller dlctlonary entries m the HECTOR dlctlonary used and more e<amples showing the usage of each word sense m HECTOR These factors are likely to have contributed to the difference in rater-annotator agreement observed m the three studies conducted We also examined the coarse sense classes derived by the greedy search algorithm Vv'e found some interesting groupings of coarse senses for nouns which ~e hst in Table 4 From Table 4, it is apparent that the greedy search algorithm can derive interesting groupings of word senses that correspond to human mtmtwe judgment of sense graz}.ulanty It Is clear that some of the disagreement between the two groups of human annotators can be attributed solely to the overly refined senses of WoRDNET As an example, there is a total Ii loop: let Ct,, C M denote the current M sense classes ~* +--oo for all z,3 such that 1 <, < 3 < M let C\[,,C~w_ 1 denote the resulting M 1 sense classes by mergmg C, and C 3 compute ~(C\[,, C~/_t) ff ~(C,, C~4_x) > ~*

"Extensive research concerning the integration of semantic knowledge into NLP for the English language has been arguably fostered by the emergence of WordNet::Similarity package (Pedersen et al. , 2004).1 In its turn, the development of the WordNet based semantic similarity software has been facilitated by the availability of tools to easily retrieve 1http://www.d.umn.edu/a0 tpederse/similarity.html data from WordNet, e.g. WordNet::QueryData,2 jwnl.3 Research integrating semantic knowledge into NLP for languages other than English is scarce.",1,original

2.1 The Yarowsky algorithm Yarowsky (1995) sparked considerable interest in bootstrapping with his successful method for word sense disambiguation.,1,original
"A variety of classifiers have been employed for this task (see Mooney [1996] and Ide and Veronis [1998] for overviews), the most popular being decision lists (Yarowsky 1994, 1995) and naive Bayesian classifiers (Pedersen 2000; Ng 1997; Pedersen and Bruce 1998; Mooney 1996; Cucerzan and Yarowsky 2002).",1,original
The Yarowsky (1995) algorithm was one of the first bootstrapping algorithms to become widely known in computational linguistics.,1,original
Yarowsky has proposed an algorithm that requires as little user input as one seed word per sense to start the training process (Yarowsky 1995).,1,original
"The best example of such an approach is (Yarowsky, 1995), who proposes a method that automatically identifies collocations that are indicative of the sense of a word, and uses those to iteratively label more examples.",1,original
"To alleviate this effort, various semi-supervised learning algorithms such as self-training (Yarowsky, 1995), cotraining (Blum and Mitchell, 1998; Goldman and Zhou, 2000), transductive SVM (Joachims, 1999) and many others have been proposed and successfully applied under different assumptions and settings.",1,original
"This method, initially proposed by (Yarowsky, 1995), was successfully evaluated in the context of the SENSEVAL framework (Mihalcea, 2002).",1,original
"Among the various knowledge-based (Lesk, 1986; Galley and McKeown, 2003; Navigli and Velardi, 2005) and data-driven (Yarowsky, 1995; Ng and Lee, 1996; Pedersen, 2001) word sense disambiguation methods that have been proposed to date, supervised systems have been constantly observed as leading to the highest performance.",1,original
"Disambiguation of a limited number of words is not hard, and necessary context information can be carefully collected and hand-crafted to achieve high disambiguation accuracy as shown in (Yarowsky, 1995).",1,original
"In order to overcome this, some unsupervised learning methods and minimally-supervised methods, e.g., (Yarowsky, 1995; Yarowsky and Wicentowski, 2000), have been proposed.",1,original

"3.2 Comparison between SVM, Bootstrapping and LP For WSD, SVM is one of the state of the art supervised learning algorithms (Mihalcea et al. , 2004), while bootstrapping is one of the state of the art semi-supervised learning algorithms (Li and Li, 2004; Yarowsky, 1995).",1,original
"5.1 Comparison to self-training For completeness, we also compared our results to the self-learning algorithm, which has commonly been referred to as bootstrapping in natural language processing and originally popularized by the work of Yarowsky in word sense disambiguation (Abney 2004; Yarowsky 1995).",1,original

"To solve this problem, we adopt an idea one sense per collocation which was introduced in word sense disambiguation research (Yarowsky, 1995).",1,original

"4.1 Methods and Parameters DL: On Senseval-2 data, we observed that DL improved significantly its performance with a smoothing technique based on (Yarowsky, 1995a).",1,original

"Statistical disambiguation such as (Collins and Brooks, 1995) for PP-attachment or (Collins, 1997; Charniak, 2000) for generative parsing greatly improve disambiguation, but as they model by imitation instead of by understanding, complete soundness has to remain elusive.",2,original
"2.3 Collinss (Bikels) Parser Collinss statistical parser (CBP; (Collins, 1997)), improved by Bikel (Bikel, 2004), is based on the probabilities between head-words in parse trees.",2,original

"Methods like McDonalds, including the wellknown Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) algorithm (Goldstein et al., 2000), are subject to another problem: Summary-level redundancy is not always well modeled by pairwise sentence-level redundancy.",2,original
Our study also shows that the simulated-annealing algorithm (Kirkpatrick et al. 1983) is more effective 1552 than the perceptron algorithm (Collins 2002) for feature weight tuning.,2,original

"Whereas Ratnaparkhi (1996) used feature support cutoffs and early stopping to stop overfitting of the model, and Collins (2002) contends that including low support features harms a maximum entropy model, our results show that low support features are useful in a regularized maximum entropy model.",2,original
"Moreover, the parameters of the model must be estimated using averaged perceptron training (Collins, 2002), which can be unstable.",2,original
"Collins (2000) and Collins and Duffy (2002) rerank the top N parses from an existing generative parser, but this kind of approach 1Dynamic programming methods (Geman and Johnson, 2002; Lafferty et al. , 2001) can sometimes be used for both training and decoding, but this requires fairly strong restrictions on the features in the model.",2,original
"While both (Johnson, 2001) and (Klein and Manning, 2002) propose models which use the parameters of the generative model but train to optimize a discriminative criteria, neither proposes training algorithms which are computationally tractable enough to be used for broad coverage parsing.",2,original

"Despite relying on a the same concept, our approach outperforms BE in most comparisons, and it often achieves higher correlations with human judgments than the string-matching metric ROUGE (Lin, 2004).",2,original
"In what concerns the evaluation process, although ROUGE (Lin, 2004) is the most common evaluation metric for the automatic evaluation of summarization, since our approach might introduce in the summary information that it is not present in the original input source, we found that a human evaluation was more adequate to assess the relevance of that additional information.",2,original

"For the Penn Treebank, (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) reports an accuracy of 96.6% using the Maximum Entropy approach, our much simpler and therefore faster HMM approach delivers 96.7%.",2,original
"As the tagger of Ratnaparkhi (1996) cannot tag a word lattice, we cannot back off to this tagging.",2,original
"Though taggers based on dependency networks (Toutanova et al. , 2003), SVM (Gimenez and M`arquez, 2003), MaxEnt (Ratnaparkhi, 1996), CRF (Smith et al. , 2005), and other methods may reach slightly better results, their train/test cycle is orders of magnitude longer.",2,original

One conclusion that we can draw is that at present the additional word features used in Ratnaparkhi (1996) looking at words more than one position away from the current do not appear to be helping the overall performance of the models.,2,original

"4 Pattern switching The compositional translation presents problems which have been reported by (Baldwin and Tanaka, 2004; Brown et al., 1993): Fertility SWTs and MWTs are not translated by a term of a same length.",0,original
"On the one hand using 1 human reference with uniform results is essential for our methodology, since it means that there is no more trouble with Recall (Papineni et al. , 2002:314)  a systems ability to avoid under-generation of N-grams can now be reliably measured.",0,original
"Our MT system was evaluated using the n-gram based Bleu (Papineni et al. , 2002) and NIST machine translation evaluation software.",0,original
"A variety of unsupervised WSD methods, which use a machinereadable dictionary or thesaurus in addition to a corpus, have also been proposed (Yarowsky 1992; Yarowsky 1995; Karov and Edelman 1998).",0,original
"Apart from the fact that we present an alternative model, our work differs from Marcu and Echihabi (2002) in two important ways.",0,original
"We used treebank grammars induced directly from the local trees of the entire WSJ section of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al. , 1993) (release 3).",0,original
"The average senior high school student achieves 57% correct (Turney, 2006).",0,original
"Second, phrase translation pairs are extracted from the word alignment corpus (Koehn et al. , 2003).",0,original
"(Yarowsky, 1995) used bootstrapping to train decision list classifiers to disambiguate between two senses of a word, achieving impressive classification accuracy.",0,original
"Identifying transliteration pairs is an important component in many linguistic applications which require identifying out-of-vocabulary words, such as machine translation and multilingual information retrieval (Klementiev and Roth, 2006b; Hermjakob et al., 2008).",0,original
"The de-facto answer came during the 1990s from the research community on Statistical Machine Translation, who made use of statistical tools based on a noisy channel model originally developed for speech recognition (Brown et al., 1994; Och and Weber, 1998; R.Zens et al., 2002; Och and Ney, 2001; Koehn et al., 2003).",0,original
"Many studies on collocation extraction are carried out based on co-occurring frequencies of the word pairs in texts (Choueka et al., 1983; Church and Hanks, 1990; Smadja, 1993; Dunning, 1993; Pearce, 2002; Evert, 2004).",0,original
"For the efficiency of minimum-error-rate training (Och, 2003), we built our development set (580 sentences) using sentences not exceeding 50 characters from the NIST MT-02 evaluation test data.",0,original

"Then, we build a classier learned by training data, using a maximum entropy model (Berger et al., 1996) and the features related to spelling variations in Table 3.",0,original
"The second alternative used BerkeleyAligner (Liang et al., 2006; DeNero and Klein, 2007), which shares information between the two alignment directions to improve alignment quality.",0,original
"Previous studies called the class of algorithms illustrated in Figure 2 cautious or sequential because in each iteration they acquire 1 or a small set of rules (Abney, 2004; Collins and Singer, 1999).",0,original
"We used the Maximum Entropy approach5 (Berger et al. , 1996) as a machine learner for this task.",0,original
"A third of the corpus is syntactically parsed as part of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al. , 1993) 2This type corresponds to Princes (1981; 1992) inferrables.",0,original

"In most cases, supervised learning methods can perform well (Pang et al., 2002).",0,original
"These models can be tuned using minimum error rate training (Och, 2003).",0,original
"4 SMT-Based Query Expansion Our SMT-based query expansion techniques are based on a recent implementation of the phrasebased SMT framework (Koehn et al. , 2003; Och and Ney, 2004).",0,original
"2.1 The Evaluator The evaluator is a function p(t\[t', s) which assigns to each target-text unit t an estimate of its probability given a source text s and the tokens t' which precede t in the current translation of s. 1 Our approach to modeling this distribution is based to a large extent on that of the IBM group (Brown et al. , 1993), but it differs in one significant aspect: whereas the IBM model involves a ""noisy channel"" decomposition, we use a linear combination of separate predictions from a language model p(tlt ~) and a translation model p(tls ).",0,original
"We use the same featuresas (Koehnet al., 2003).",0,original
6.1 Reader Judgments There is a growing concern surrounding issues of intercoder reliability when using human judgments to evaluate discourse-processing algorithms (Carletta 1996; Condon and Cech 1995).,0,original
"However, as discussed in prior arts (Galley et al., 2004) and this paper, linguistically-informed SCFG is an inadequate model for parallel corpora due to its nature that only allowing child-node reorderings.",0,original
"1 Introduction The field of sentiment classification has received considerable attention from researchers in recent years (Pang and Lee 2002, Pang et al. 2004, Turney 2002, Turney and Littman 2002, Wiebe et al. 2001, Bai et al. 2004, Yu and Hatzivassiloglou 2003 and many others).",0,original
"And indeed, the agreement figures went up from K = 0.63 to K = 0.68 (ignoring doubts) when we did so, i.e., within the ""tentative"" margins of agreement according to Carletta (1996) (0.68 <_ x < 0.8).",0,original
"Second, we follow Snow et al.s work (2006) on taxonomy induction in incorporating transitive closure constraints in our probability calculations, as explained below.",0,original
"PP-model WecollectedthePPparametersbysimply reading the alignment matrices resulting from the word alignment, in a way similar to the one described in (Koehn et al. , 2003).",0,original
"Researchers extracted opinions from words, sentences, and documents, and both rule-based and statistical models are investigated (Wiebe et al. , 2002; Pang et al. , 2002).",0,original
"There are many different similarity measures, which variously use taxonomic lexical hierarchies or lexical-semantic networks, large text corpora, word definitions in machine-readable dictionaries or other semantic formalisms, or a combination of these (Dagan, Marcus, and Markovitch 1993; Kozima and Furugori 1993; Pereira, Tishby, and Lee 1993; Church et al. 1994; Grefenstette 1994; Resnik 1995; McMahon and Smith 1996; Jiang and Conrath 1997; Sch utze 1998; Lin 1998; Resnik and Diab 2000; Budanitsky 1999; Budanitsky and Hirst 2001, 2002).",0,original
"Some regarded Wikipedia as the corpora and applied hand-crafted or machine-learned rules to acquire semantic relations (Herbelot and Copestake, 2006; Kazama and Torisawa, 2007; Ruiz-casado et al., 2005; Nastase and Strube, 2008; Sumida et al., 2008; Suchanek et al., 2007).",0,original
"Collins (1997)s parser and its reimplementation and extension by Bikel (2002) have by now been applied to a variety of languages: English (Collins, 1999), Czech (Collins et al. , 1999), German (Dubey and Keller, 2003), Spanish (Cowan and Collins, 2005), French (Arun and Keller, 2005), Chinese (Bikel, 2002) and, according to Dan Bikels web page, Arabic.",0,original
"This leads to 49 methods that use semi-supervised techniques on a treebank-infered grammar backbone, such as (Matsuzaki et al., 2005; Petrov et al., 2006).",0,original
"1 Introduction In phrase-based statistical machine translation (Koehn et al., 2003) phrases extracted from word-aligned parallel data are the fundamental unit of translation.",0,original
"Measurement of B.eliability The Kappa Statistic Following Jean Carletta (1996), we use the kappa statistic (Sidney Siegel and N. John Castellan Jr. , 1988) to measure degree of agreement among subjects.",0,original
"Table 2 shows results in lowercase BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) for both the baseline (B) and the improved baseline systems (B5) on development and held151 out evaluation sets.",0,original
"We used MXPOST (Ratnaparkhi, 1996), and in order to discover more general patterns, we map the tag set down after tagging, e.g. NN, NNP, NNPS and NNS all map to NN.",0,original
Many other projects have used statistics in a way that summarizes facts about the text but does not draw any explicit conclusions from them (Finch and Chater 1992; Hindle 1990).,0,original
"Not only many combinations are found in the corpus, many of them have very similar mutual information values to that of 318 Table 2: economic impact verb economic financial political social budgetary ecological economic economic economic economic economic economic economic economic economic object impact impact impact impact impact impact effect implication consequence significance fallout repercussion potential ramification risk mutual freq info 171 1.85 127 1.72 46 0.50 15 0.94 8 3.20 4 2.59 84 0.70 17 0.80 59 1.88 10 0.84 7 1.66 7 1.84 27 1.24 8 2.19 17 -0.33 nomial distribution can be accurately approximated by a normal distribution (Dunning, 1993).",0,original
"We use Minimal Error Rate Training (Och, 2003) to maximize BLEU on the complete development data.",0,original
"Like the models of Goodman (1997), the additional features in our model are generated probabilistically, whereas in the parser of Collins (1997) distance measures are assumed to be a function of the already generated structure and are not generated explicitly.",0,original
"However, (Fraser and Marcu, 2007a) show that, in phrase-based translation, improvements in AER or f-measure do not necessarily correlate with improvements in BLEU score.",0,original
"While it was initially believed that lexicalization of PCFG parsers (Collins, 1997; Charniak, 2000) is crucial for obtaining good parsing results, Gildea (2001) demonstrated that the lexicalized Model-1 parser of Collins (1997) does not benefit from bilexical information when tested on a new text domain, and only marginally benefits from such information when tested on the same text domain as the training corpora.",0,original
"The model is defined mathematically (Koehn and Hoang, 2007) as following: p(f|e) = 1Zexp nsummationdisplay i=1 ihi(f,e) (1) where i is a vector of weights determined during a tuning process, and hi is the feature function.",0,original
"The word alignment models implemented in GIZA++, the so-called IBM (Brown et al., 1993) and HMM alignment models (Vogel et al., 1996) are typical implementation of the EM algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977).",0,original
"3.2 ITG Constraints In this section, we describe the ITG constraints (Wu, 1995; Wu, 1997).",0,original
"Secondly, we used the Kappa coefficient (Carletta, 1996), which has become the standard evaluation metric and the score obtained was 0.905.",0,original
"Unfortunately, this is not always the case, and the above methodology suffers from the weaknesses pointed out by (Wu, 1997) concerning parse-parse-match procedures.",0,original
"We then piped the text through a maximum entropy sentence boundary detector (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) and performed text normalization using NSW tools (Sproat et al, 2001).",0,original
"For every pair of nouns, where each noun had a total frequency in the triple data of 10 or more, we computed their distributional similarity using the measure given by Lin (1998).",0,original
"One of the main directions is sentiment classification, which classifies the whole opinion document (e.g., a product review) as positive or negative (e.g., Pang et al, 2002; Turney, 2002; Dave et al, 2003; Ng et al. 2006; McDonald et al, 2007).",0,original
"Although this approach can give inaccurate estimates, the counts given to the incorrect senses will disperse randomly throughout the hierarchy as noise, and by accumulating counts up the hierarchy we will tend to gather counts from the correct senses of related words (Yarowsky, 1992; Resnik, 1993).",0,original
"8 Conclusions In this paper, we developed probability models for the multi-level transfer rules presented in (Galley et al. , 2004), showed how to acquire larger rules that crucially condition on more syntactic context, and how to pack multiple derivations, including interpretations of unaligned words, into derivation forests.",0,original
"Zens and Ney (2003) explore the re-orderings allowed by ITGs, and provide a formulation for the number of structures that can be built for a sentence pair of size n. ITGs explore almost all of permutation space when n is small, but their coverage of permutation space falls off quickly for n > 5 (Wu, 1997).",0,original
"We present a new implication of Wus (1997) Inversion Transduction Grammar (ITG) Hypothesis, on the problem of retrieving truly parallel sentence translations from large collections of highly non-parallel documents.",0,original
"5.5 Applying F-score Optimization Technique In addition, we can simply apply the F-score optimization technique for the sequence labeling tasks proposed in (Suzuki et al. , 2006) to boost the HySOL performance since the base discriminative models pD(y|x) and discriminative combination, namely Equation (3), in our hybrid model basically uses the same optimization procedure as CRFs.",0,original
"For example, syntactic features (Ng and Cardie, 2002b; Luo and Zitouni, 2005) can be computed this way and are used in our system.",0,original
"To tune all lambda weights above, we perform minimum error rate training (Och, 2003) on the development set described in Section 7.",0,original
"Recent work has applied Bayesian non-parametric models to anaphora resolution (Haghighi and Klein, 2007), lexical acquisition (Goldwater, 2007) and language modeling (Teh, 2006) with good results.",0,original
"2 Motivation In the past, work has been done in the area of characterizing words and phrases according to their emotive tone (Turney and Littman, 2003; Turney, 2002; Kamps et al. , 2002; Hatzivassiloglou and Wiebe, 2000; Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 2002; Wiebe, 2000), but in many domains of text, the values of individual phrases may bear little relation to the overall sentiment expressed by the text.",0,original
2 The Inversion Transduction Grammar The Inversion Transduction Grammar of Wu (1997) can be thought as a a generative process which simultaneously produces strings in both languages through a series of synchronous context-free grammar productions.,0,original
"Many of the current approaches of domain modeling collapse together different instances and make the decision on what information is important for a domain based on this generalized corpus (Collier, 1998; Barzilay and Lee, 2003; Sudo et al. , 2003).",0,original
"We used a maximummatching algorithm and a dictionary compiled from the CTB (Sproat et al. , 1996; Xue, 2001) to do segmentation, and trained a maximum entropy part-ofspeech tagger (Ratnaparkhi, 1998) and TAG-based parser (Bikel and Chiang, 2000) on the CTB to do tagging and parsing.4 Then the same feature extraction and model-training was done for the PDN corpus as for the CTB.",0,original
"This can be done automatically with unparsed corpora (Briscoe and Carroll 1997, Manning 1993, Ushioda et al. 1993), from parsed corpora such as Marcus et al.'s (1993) Treebank (Merlo 1994, Framis 1994) or manually as was done for COMLEX (Macleod and Grishman 1994).",0,original

"It differs from the many approaches where (1) is defined by a stochastic synchronous grammar (Wu, 1997; Alshawi et al. , 2000; Yamada and Knight, 2001; Eisner, 2003; Gildea, 2003; Melamed, 2004) and from transfer-based systems defined by context-free grammars (Lavie et al. , 2003).",0,original
"We can stipulate the time line to be linearly ordered (although it is not in approaches that build ignorance of relative times into the representation of time (e.g. , Hobbs, 1974) nor in approaches using branching futures (e.g. , McDermott, 1985)), and we can stipulate it to be dense (although it is not in the situation calculus).",0,original
"Fortunately, using distributional characteristics of term contexts, it is feasible to induce part-of-speech categories directly from a corpus of suf cient size, as several papers have made clear (Brown et al. , 1992; Schcurrency1utze, 1993; Clark, 2000).",0,original
"They train from the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al. , 1993); a collection of 40,000 sentences that are labeled with corrected parse trees (approximately a million word tokens).",0,original
"The second approach (Sekine et al. 1992; Chang, Luo, and Su 1992; Resnik 1993a; Grishman and Sterling 1994; Alshawi and Carter 1994) takes triples (verb, prep, noun2) and (nounl, prep, noun2), like those in Table 10, as training data for acquiring semantic knowledge and performs PP-attachment disambiguation on quadruples.",0,original

"If the language model Pr(eI1) = p (eI1) depends on parameters and the translation model Pr(fJ1 jeI1) = p (fJ1 jeI1) depends on parameters, then the optimal parameter values are obtained by maximizing the likelihood on a parallel training corpus fS1;eS1 (Brown et al. , 1993):  = argmax SY s=1 p (fsjes) (3)  = argmax SY s=1 p (es) (4) Computational Linguistics (ACL), Philadelphia, July 2002, pp.",0,original

"It was also included in the DUC 2004 evaluation plan where summary quality was automatically judged using a set of n-gram word overlap metrics called ROUGE (Lin and Hovy, 2003).",0,original
"Due to the parameter interdependencies introduced by the one-to-one assumption, we are unlikely to find a method for decomposing the assignments into parameters that can be estimated independently of each other as in Brown et al. \[1993b, Equation 26\]).",0,original
"We show that the method of (Daume III, 2007), which was presented as a simple preprocessing step, is actually equivalent, except our representation explicitly separates hyperparameters which were tied in his work.",0,original
"In addition to their use in machine translation (Sato & Nagao, 1990; Brown et al. , 1993; Melamed, 1997), translation models can be applied to machineassisted translation (Sato, 1992; Foster et al. , 1996), cross-lingual information retrieval (SIGIR, 1996), and gisting of World Wide Web pages (Resnik, 1997).",0,original

"Despite the above differences, since the theorems of convergence and their proof (Collins, 2002) are only dependent on the feature vectors, and not on the source of the feature definitions, the perceptron algorithm is applicable to the training of our CWS model.",0,original
"We selected 580 short sentences of length at most 50 characters from the 2002 NIST MT Evaluation test set as our development corpus and used it to tune s by maximizing the BLEU score (Och, 2003), and used the 2005 NIST MT Evaluation test set as our test corpus.",0,original

",.~.eqmvalent ot duty in a parallel French text, the correct sense of the Enghsh word is identified These studies exploit th~s lnformatmn m order to gather co-occurrence data for the different senses, which ts then used to dtsamb~guate new texts In related work, Dywk (1998) used patterns of translational relatmns in an EnghshNorwegian paralle ! corpus (ENPC, Oslo Umverslty) to define semantic propemes such as synonymy, ambtgmty, vagueness, and semantic helds and suggested a derivation otsemantic representations for signs (eg, lexemes), captunng semantm relatmnshlps such as hyponymy etc, fiom such translatmnal relatmns Recently, Resnlk and Yarowsky (1997) suggested that fol the purposes ot WSD, the different senses of a wo~d could be detelmlned by considering only sense d~stmctmns that are lextcahzed cross-hngmstlcally In particular, they propose that some set of target languages be ~dent~fied, and that the sense d~stmctmns to be considered for language processing appllcatmns and evaluatmn be restricted to those that are reahzed lexlcally in some minimum subset of those languages This idea would seem to p~ovtde an answer, at least m part, to the problem of determining different senses of a word mtumvely, one assumes that ff another language lexlcahzes a word m two or more ways, there must be a conceptual monvatmn If we look at enough languages, we would be likely to fred the s~gmficant lexlcal differences that dehmtt different senses of a word However, th~s suggestmn raises several questions Fo~ instance, ~t ~s well known that many amb~gumes are preserved across languages (for example, the French tntdrYt and the Enghsh interest), especmlly languages that are relatively closely related Assuming this problem can be overcome, should differences found m closely related languages be given lesser (or greater) weight than those found m more distantly related languages 9 More generally, which languages should be considered for this exermse 9 All languages 9 Closely related languages9 Languages from different language famlhes '~ A mixture of the two 9 How many languages, and of which types, would be ""enough"" to provide adequate lnfotmanon tot this purpose~ There ts also the questmn ot the crlterm that would be used to estabhsh that a sense distinction is ""lexlcahzed cross-hngu~stmally"" How consistent must the d~stlnCtlOn be 9 Does it mean that two concepts are expressed by mutually non-lntetchangeable lexmal items in some slgmficant number ot other languages, or need tt only be the case that the option ot a different lexlcahzatlon exists m a certain percentage of cases 9 Another conslderatmn ts where the cross-hngual mformatlon to answer these questmns would come from Using bdmgual dictionaries would be extremely tedmus and error-prone, g~ven the substantial d~vergence among d~ctlonanes in terms of the kinds and degree of sense dlstmctmns they make Resmk and Yalowsky (1997) suggest EutoWordNet (Vossen, 1998) as a possible somce of mformatmn, but, given that EuroWordNet ts pttmatdy a lexmon and not a corpus, ~t is subject to many of the same objections as for bl-hngual dictionaries An alternative would be to gather the reformation from parallel, ahgned corpma Unlike bilingual and muttt-hngual dictionaries, translatmn eqmvalents xn parallel texts a~e determined by experienced translatols, who evaluate each instance ot a word's use m context rather than as a part of the meta-hngmst~c actlvlty of classifying senses for mclusmn in a dictionary However, at present very few parallel ahgned corpora exist The vast majority ot these are bl-texts, mvolwng only two languages, one of which is very often English Ideally, a serious 53 evaluation of Resnik and Yarowsky's proposal would include parallel texts m languages from several different language families, and, to maximally ensure that the word m question is used in the exact same sense across languages, ~t would be preferable that the same text were used over all languages in the study The only currently avadable parallel corpora for more than two languages are Olwell's Nmeteen Eighty-Four (Erjavec and Ide, 1998), Plato's Repubhc (Erjavec, et al, 1998), the MULTEXT Journal .o/ the Commt.~ston corpus (Ide and V6roms, 1994), and the Bible (Resnlk, et al, m press) It is likely that these corpora do not provide enough appropriate data to reliably determine sense distinctions Also, ~t Is not clear how the lexlcahzatlon of sense distractions across languages Is affected by genre, domain, style, etc Thls paper attempts to provide some prehmlnary answers to the questions outhned above, In order to eventually determine the degree to which the use of parallel data ts vmble to determine sense distinctions, and, ff so, the ways in which th~s reformation might be used Given the lack of lalge parallel texts across multiple languages, the study is necessarily hmlted, however, close exammanon of a small sample of parallel data can, as a first step, provide the basis and dlrectmn for more extensive studies 1 Methodology I have conducted a small study using parallel, aligned versmns ot George Orwell's Nineteen Etghtv-Fo,lr (Euavec and Ide, 1998)m five languages Enghsh, Slovene, Estonian, Romanlan, and Czech I The study therefole Involves languages from four language families The O~well parallel corpus also includes vers|ons o) Ntneteen-E~gho Four m Hungarian, Bulgarmn, Latwan, Llthuaman, Se~bmn, and Russmn (Germanic, Slavic, Fmno-Ugrec, and Romance), two languages from the same family (Czech and Slovene), as well as one non-Indo-European language (Estoman) Nmeteen Eighty-Four Is a text of about 100,000 words, translated directly from the original English m each of the other languages The parallel versions of the text are sentence-aligned to the English and tagged for part of speech Although Nineteen Eighty-Four is a work of fiction, Orwell's prose IS not highly stylized and, as such, it provides a reasonable sample ot modern, ordinary language that ~s not tied to a given topic or sub-domain (such as newspapers, technical reports, etc ) Furthermore, the translations of the text seem to be relatively faithful to the original for instance, over 95% ot the sentence alignments in the full pmallel corpus of seven languages are one-to-one (Prlest-Dorman, et al, 1997) Nine ambiguous English words were considered hard, head, country, hne, promise, shght, seize, scrap, float The first four were chosen because they have been used in other dlsamb~guatlon studies, the latter five were chosen from among the words used m the Senseval dlsamblguatlon exercise (Kllgamff and Palmer, forthcoming) In all cases, the study was necessarily hmlted to words that occurred frequently enough in the Orwell text to warrant consideration F~ve hundred forty-two sentences conta|nmg an occurrence or occurrences (Including morphological variants) of each of the nine words were extracted from the Enghsh text, together w~th the parallel sentences m which they occur m the texts ot the four comparison languages (Czech, Estonian, Romantan, Slovene) As Walks and Stevenson (1998) have pointed out, pa~t-of-speech tagging accomplishes a good portion of the work ot semantic dlsamb~guatmn, therefore occmrences of wolds that appemed in the data in more than 54 one part of speech were grouped separately 2 The Enghsh occurrences were then grouped usmg the sense distinctions m WordNet, (version 1 6) \[Miller et al, 1990, Fellbaum, 1998\]) The sense categonzatmn was performed by the author and two student assistants, results from the three were compared and a final, mutually agreeable set of sense assignments was estabhshed For each of the four comparison languages, the corpus of sense-grouped parallel sentences were sent to a llngmst and natl,ve speaker of the comparison language The hngmsts were asked to provide the lexlcal item m each parallel sentence that corresponds to the ambiguous Enghsh word If inflected, they were asked to provide both the inflected form and the root form In addttmn, the lmgmsts were asked to indicate the type of translatmn, according to the dtstmctmns given m Table 1 For over 85% of the Enghsh word occurrences (corresponding to types 1 and 2 m Table 1), a specific lexlcal item or items could be identified as the translation equivalent for the corresponding Enghsh word For comparison purposes, each translanon equivalent was represented by ~ts lemma (or the lemma of the toot form in the case of derivatives) and associated w~th the WordNet sense to which it corresponds In order to determine the degree to which the assigned sense dlstlncttons correspond to translation eqmvalents, a coherence index ( Cl) was computed that measures how often each pmr of senses is translated usmg the same word as well as the consistency with which a g~ven se,ls,z ~s translated with the same word ~ Note that the z The adJective and adverb senses of hard are consadeied together because the distinction is not consistent across the translations used m the study Note that the CI ~s similar to semanuc entropy (Melamed, 1997) However, Melamed computes CIs do not determine whether or not a sense dtstmctton can be lextcahzed in the target language, but only the degree to whmh they are lexicahzed differently m the translated text However, tt can be assumed that the CIs provide a measure of the tendency to lex~cahze different WordNet senses differently, which can m turn be seen as an mdtcatmn of the degree to which the distraction ts vahd For each ambiguous word, the CI Is computed for each pair of senses, as follows S<q t> Cl(sqS, ) = '=1 m rnrt where @ n ~s the number of comparison languages under consideration, nl~q and m,, are the nt~mber of occurrences olsense sqand sense s~ m the Enghsh corpus, respectively, including occurrences that have no idenufiable translation, s<~ ~>m ts the number of times that senses q and r are translated by

languages If sense and sense ) are consistently translated w~th the same wo~d in each comparison language, then Cl(s, s~) = 1, if they are translated with a different word m every occurrence, Cl(s, ~) = 0 In general, the CI for pans of different senses provides an index of thmr relatedness, t e, the greater the value of Cl(s, sj), the more frequently occurrences of-sense t and sense j are translated with the same lextcal item When t = j, we entropy tOl wold types, lather than word senses 55 obtain a measure of the coherence of a ~lven sense Type Meaning 1 A slngle lexlcal Item is used

(1997) suggest that confusing freer-grained sense dtstmctlons should be penahzed less severely than confusing grosser d~stmct~ons when evaluatmg the performance of sense dtsambtguatt0n systems The clusters also provide insight into the lexlcallzatlon of sense dtstmcttons related by various semantic relations (metonymy, meronymy, etc ) across languages, for instance, the ""part of the body"" and ""intellect"" senses of head are lex~cahzed with the same ~tem a s~gnlficant portion of the t~me across all languages, reformation that could be used m machine translatton In addtt~on, cluster data such as that presented here could be used m lexicography, to determine a mole detaded hierarchy of relations among senses in dtct~onary entries It is less clear how cross-hngual reformation can be used to determine sense d~st~nctlons independent of a pre-deflned set, such as the WordNet senses used here In an effort to explore how thts mlght be done, I have used the small sample from thts study to create word groupmgs from ""back translations"" (l e, additional translations m the original language ot the translations m the target language) and developed a metric that uses th~s mformatton to determine relatedness between occurrences, whtch ~s m turn used to cluster occurrences into sense groups I have also compared sets of back translations for words representing the various WordNet senses, which provtde word groups s~mdar to WordNet synsets Interestingly, there ts virtually no overlap between the WordNet synsets and word groups generated from back translations The results show, however, that sense dlstmctlons useful for natural language processing tasks such as machme translanon could potentsally be determined, ot at least influenced, by constdeHng this mformatton The automatically generated synsets themselves may also be useful m the same apphcatlons; where WordNet synsets (and ontologtes) have been used tn the past More work needs to be done on the topic of cross-hngual sense determination, utthzmg substantially larger parallel corpora that include a variety ot language types as well as texts fiom several genres This small study explores a possible methodology to apply when such resources become avatlable Acknowledgements The author would hke to gratefully acknowledge the contrtbut~on of those who provided the translatton mfotmat~on Tomaz Eua~ec

"Towards a Meaning-Full Comparison of Lexieal Resources Kenneth C Lltkowska CL Research 9208 Gue Road Damascus, MD 20872 ken@clres corn http//www tires tom Abstract The mapping from WordNet to Hector senses m Senseval provides a ""gold standard"" against wluch to judge our ability to compare lexlcal resources The ""gold standard"" is provided through a word overlap analysis (with and without a stop list) for flus mapping, achieving at most a 36 percent correct mapping (inflated by 9 percent from ""empty"" assignments) An alternaUve componenttal analysis of the defimtaons, using syntacUc, collocatmnal, and semantac component and relation identification (through the use ofdefimng patterns integrated seamlessly mto the parsing thclaonary), provides an almost 41 percent correct mapping, with an additaonal 4 percent by recogmzmg semantic components not used in the Senseval mapping Defimtion sets of the Senseval words from three pubhshed thclaonanes and Dorr's lextcal knowledge base were added to WordNet and the Hector database to exanune the nature of the mapping process between defimtton sets of more and less sco\[~e The tecbauques described here consUtute only an maaal implementation of the componenUal analysis approach and suggests that considerable further improvements can be aclueved Introduction The difficulty of companng lemcal resources, long a s~gnfficant challenge in computauonal hnguistlcs (Atlans, 1991), came to the fore in the recent Senseval competatton (IOlgarnff, 1998), when some systems that relied heavily on the WordNet (Miller, et al, 1990) sense inventory were faced with the necessity of using another sense inventory (Hecto0 A hasty solutaon to the problem was the "" development of a map between the two inventories, but some part~cipants expressed concerns that use of flus map may have degraded their performance to an unknown degree Although there were disclaimers about the WordNet-Hector map, it nonetheless stands as a usable gold standard for efforts to compare lexical resources Moreover, we have a usable baseline (a word overlap method suggested m (Lesk, 1986)) against which to compare whether we are able to make improvements m the mapping (since flus method has been shown to perform not as well as expected (Krovetz, 1992)) We first describe the lextcal resources used m the study (Hector, WordNet, other dicUonanes, and a lex~cal knowledge base), first characterizing them in terms ofpolysemy and the types of leracal mformaUon each contmns (syntacUc properties and features, semantac components and relaUons, and collocaUonal properties) We then present results of perfornung the word overlap analysis of the 18 verbs used m Senseval, analyzing the definitions m WordNet and Hector We then expand our analysis to include other dictionaries We describe our methods of analysis, particularly the methods of parsing defimtaons and identff)qng semantic relations (semrels) based on defimng patterns, essentially takang first steps m Implementing the program described by Atkms and focusmg on the use of""meamng"" full mformataon rather than statistical mformaUon We identify the results that have been achieved thus far and outline further steps that may add more ""meanmg"" to the analysis IAll analyses described m this paper were performed automatically using functlonahty incorporated m DIMAP

and phrases), specifically the followmg AMAZE, BAND, BET, BOTHER, BURY, CALCULATE, CONSUME, DERIVE, FLOAT, HURDLE, INVADE, PROMISE, SACK, SANCTION, SCRAP, SEIZE, SHAKE, SLIGHT The Hector database used In Senseval consists of a tree of senses, each of which contains defimttons, syntactic properties, example usages, and ""clues"" (collocational information about the syntactic and semantic enwronment in wluch a word appears in the spectfic sense) The WordNet database contmns synonyms (synsets), perhaps a defimtton or example usages (gloss), some syntactic mformaUon (verb frames), hypernyms, hyponyms, and some other semrels (ENTAILS, CAUSES) To extend our analysis In order to look at other issues of lexacal resource comparison, we have included the defirauons or leracal information from the following additional sources  Webster's 3 ra New International Dictionary (W3)  Oxford Advanced l.earners D~ctlonary (OALD)  American Hentage DlcUonary (AI-ID)  Dorr's Lexacal Knowledge Base

the lexicographer's mappmg from WordNet 1 6 to Hector, using a s~mple word overlap analysis smular to (Lesk, 1986) The lextcographer mapped the 66 WordNet senses (each synset m which a test occurred) Into 102 Hector senses A total of 86 assignments were made, 9 WordNet senses were gwen no assignments, 40 recewed exactly one, and 17 senses received 2 or 3 asssgnments The WordNet senses contained 348 words (about half of wluch were common words appeanng on our stop list, which contained 165 words, mostly preposmons, pronouns, and conjunctions) The Hector senses selected m the word overlap analysis contained about 960 words (all Hector senses contained 1878 words) We performed a strict word overlap analysts (with and wsthout a stop hst) between tile definlUons in WordNet and the Hector senses, that is, we did not attempt to ldenttfy root forms of Inflected words We took each word m a WordNet sense and determined whether ~t appeared in a Hector sense, we selected a Hector sense based on the highest percentage of words over all Hector senses An 31 empty selection was made ff all the words in the WordNet sense did not appear in any Hector sense, only content words were considered when the stop hst was used For example, for bet, WordNet sense 2 (stake (money) on the outcome of an issue) mapped into Hector sense 4 ((of a person) to risk (a sum of money or property) m thts way) In this case, there was an overlap on two words (money, 039 in the Hector defimtlon (0 13 of its 15 words) without the stop list When the stop list was invoked, there was an overlap of only one word (money, 0 07 of the Hector defimtion) In this case, the lexicographer had made three assignments (Hector senses 2, 3, and 4), our scoring method treated flus as only 1 out of 3 correct (not using the relaxed method employed in Senseval of treating flus as completely correct) Without the stop hst, our selections matched the lexicographer's in 28 of 86 cases (32 6%), using the stop list, we were successful in 31 of 86 cases (36 1%) The improvement arising when the stop list was used is deceptive, where 8 cases were due to empty assignments (so that only 23 cases, 26 7%, were due to matching content words) Overall, only 41 content words were involved in these 23 successes when the stop list was used, an average of I 8 content words To summanze the word overlap analysis (1) despite a ncher set of defimtions in Hector, 9 of 66 WordNet senses (13 6%) could not be assigned, (2) despite the greater detail in Hector senses compared to WordNet senses (2 8 times as many words), only 1 8 content words participated in the assignments, and (3) therefore, the defimng vocabulary between these two definition sets seems to be somewhat divergent Although it might appear as if the word overlap analysis does not perform well, this is not the case The analysis provides a broad overview of the defimuon companson process between two definmon sets and frames a deeper analysis of the differences Moreover, it appears that the accuracy of a ""gold standard"" mapping is not crucially important The quality of the mapping may help frame the subsequent analysis more precisely, but it seems sufficient that any reasonable mapping will suffice This will be discussed further after presenting the results of the componentlal analysis of the defimtlons 32 Meaning-Full Analysis of Definitions The deeper analysis of the mapping between two defimtion sets relies primarily on two major steps (1) parsing definitions and using defimng patterns to identify semrels present m the definitions and (2) relaxing values to these relations by allowing ""synonymic"" substitution (using WordNet) Thus, for example, ffwe identify hypernyms or instruments from parsing a defimtion, we would say that the defimtions are ""equal"" not just ffthe hypernym or instrument is the same word, but also Lf the hypernyms or instruments are members of the same synset This approach is based on the finding (Litkowski, 1978) that a dictionary induces a semantic network where nodes represent ""concepts"" that may be lexicahzed and verbalized in more than one way This finding implies, in general, the absence of true synonyms, and instead the kind of ""concept"" embodied in WordNet synsets (with several lexical items and phraseologles) A slmdar approach, parsing defimtlons and relaxing semrel values, was followed in (Dolan, 1994) for clnstenng related senses w~thin a single dictionary The ideal toward which this approach strives is a complete identification of the meamng components included in a defimtion The meaning components can include syntactic features and charactenstlcs (including subcategonzation patterns), semantm components (realized through identification of semrels), selectional restrictions, and coUocational specifications The first stage of the analysis parses the definitions (CL Research, 1999b, Litkowski, to appear) and uses the parse results to extract (via defining patterns) semrels Since definitions have many idiosyncrasies (that do not follow ordinary text), an important first step in this stage is preprocessmg the definition text to put it into a sentence frame that facilitates the extraction of semrels 2 2Note that the stop hst is not applicable to the definition parsing The parser is a full-scale sentence parser, where prepositmns and other words on the stop list are necessary for successful parsing Moreover, inclusion of the prepositions is cmcml to the method, since they are the bearers of much semrel information The extractmn of semrels examines the parse results, a e, a tree whose mtermedaate nodes represent non-ternunals and whose leaves represent the lextcal atems that compnse the defimuons, where any node may also include annotations such as characterizations of number and tense For all noun or verb defimttons, flus includes Identification of the head noun (with recogmtton of""empty"" heads) or verb, for verbs, we signal whether the defimtaon contmned any selecttonal restnctmus (that as, pamcular parenthesazed expressaons) for the subject and object We then exanune preposattonal phrases In the defimUon and deterrmne whether we have a ""defining pattern"" for the preposaUon whach we can use as mdacaUve of a partacular semrel We also identify adverbs m the parse tree and look these up in WordNet to adentffy an adjecuve synset from wluch they are derived (if one is gwen) The defimng pattems are actually part of the dictionary used by the parser That is, we do not have to develop specafic routines to look for specLfic patterns A defimng pattern ~s a regular expressaon that arlaculates a syntactac pattern to be matched Thus, to recograze a ""manner"" semrel, we have the foUowmg entry for ""m"" m(dpat((~ rep0 l(det(0)) adj manner(0) st(manner)))) This allows us to recognize ""m"" as possibly gwmg rise to a ""manner"" component, where we recogmze ""m"" (the tdde, which allows us to specify partacular elements before the ""m"" as well), vath a noun phrase that consasts of 0 or 1 determiner, an adjectwe, and the lateral ""manner"" The '0  after the detenmner and the hteral mdacate that these words are not copied into the value for a ""manner"" role, so that the value to the ""manner"" semrel becomes only the adjectwe that as recogmzed The second stage of the analysis uses the populated lexacal database to compare senses and make the selectaons This process follows the general methodology used m Senseval (Lltkowska, to appear) Specifically, m the defimtaon comparison, we first exanune exclusaon cntena to rule out specific mappings These criteria include syntacUc properUes (e g, a verb sense that Is only transluve cannot map into one that Is only mtransRave) and collocataonal propertaes (e g, a sense that is used with a parUcle cannot map into one that uses a different particle) At the present tune, these are used only rmmmally 33 We next score each viable sense based on rots semrels We increment the score ff the senses have a common hypernym or If a sense's hypernyms belong  to the same synset as the other sense's hypernyms If a parUcular sense con~ns a large number of synonyms (that as, no differentiae on the hypernym) and they overlap consaderably m the synsets they evoke, the score can be increased substanUally Currently, we add 5 points for each match 3 We increment the score based on common semrels In tins amtml tmplementaUon, we have defimng patterns (usually qmte nummal) for recogmzmg Instrument, means, location, purpose, source, manner, has-constituents, has-members, is-part-of, locale, and goal 4 We Increment the score by 2 points when we have a common semrel and then by another 5 points when the value Is ~dentacal or m the same synset After all possable increments to the scores have been made, we then select the sense(s) w~th the lughest score Finally, we compare our selecuon with that of the gold standard to assess our mapping over all senses Another way an wluch our methodology follows the Senseval process as that at proceeds incrementally Thus, ~t ms not necessary to have a ""final"" perfect parse and mapping rouUne We can make conUnual refinements at any stage of the process and exarmne the overall effect As m Senseval, we may make changes to deal wath a particular phenomenon with the result that overall performance dechnes, but w~th a sounder basis for making subsequent amprovements Results of Componential Analysis The ""gold standard"" analysis Involves mapping 66 WordNet senses with 348 words into 102 Hector senses with 1878 words Using the method described above, we obtained 35 out of 86 correct 3At the present tame, we use WordNet to adentffy semreis We envaslon usmg the full semanlac network created by parsing all a dlcUonary's defimtaons Thas would include a richer set of semrels than currently included m WordNet 4The defimng patterns are developed by hand We have onlyJust begun this effort, so the current set ms somewhat Impoverished mappmgs (407%), a shght improvement over the 31 correct assignments usmg the stop-last word overlap techmque However, as mentioned above, the stophst techmque had aclueved 8 of its successes by matclung null assignments Consadered on tlus basins, ~t seems that the componentaal analysis techmque provides substantial ~mprovement In addition, our technique ""erred"" on 4 cases by malang assagnments where none were made by the leracographer We suggest that these cases do con~n some common elements of meaning and may conceivably not be construed as errors The mapping from WordNet to Hector had relatavely few empty mappings, senses for wtuch It was not possable to make an assignment These are the cases where at appears that the chetmnanes do not overlap and thus prowde a tentative mdacataon of where two dictionaries may have different coverage The cases of multiple assignments mchcate the degree ofamblgmty m the mapping The average m both darecUons between Hector and WordNet were donunated by the mabdaty to obtain good dascnnunatton for the word ""semze"" Thus, tlus method identifies individual words where the &scnnunatwe ablhty needs to be further refined  Perhaps more importantly, the componentml analysis method exploits consaderably more WordNet Hector  mformauon than the word overlap methods Whereas the stop-hst word overlap mapping was  based on only 41 content words, the componenual ~ approach (In the selected mappings) had 228 hits in ~.~  developing ats scores, with only a small number of ~ .~ ~ defining patterns Comparison of Dictionaries tel O ~3 0'3 We next exanuned the nature of the mterrelalaons between parrs of chctaonanes w~thout use of a ""gold standard"" to assess the process of mapping For t/us purpose, we mapped m both &recttons between the paars {WordNet, Hector}, {W3, OALD}, and {W3, AHD We exanune Dorr's lexacal knowledge base for the amphcatlons It may have m the mapping process Neither WordNet nor Hector are properly v~ewed as chcuonanes, since there was no mtenuon to pubhsh them as such WordNet ""glosses"" are generally smaller (53 words per sense) compared to Hector (184 words per sense), whach contains many words specff3nng selectmnal restnct~ons on the subject and object of the verbs Hector was used primarily for a large-scale sense tagging project The three formal d~ctmnanes were subject to rigorous pubhslung and style standards The average number of words per sense were 87 (OALD), 7 1 (AHD), and 9 9 (W3), w~th an average of 3 4, 62, and 120 senses per word Each table shows the average number of senses being mapped, the average number of assignments m the target dlCtmnary, the average number of senses for which no assagnment could be made, the average number of mulUple assignments per word, and the average score of the assignments that were made WN-Hector 37 47 06 17 119 Hector-WN 57 64 14 22 113 These points are further emphasized m the mapping between W3 and OALD, where the disparity between the empty and mulUple assagnments indicate that we are mapping between dictionaries qmte disparate This tends to be the case not only for the enUre set of words, but also is evident for individual words where there is a considerable d~spanty m the number of senses, wtuch then dominate the overall dlspanty Thus, for example, W3 has 41 defimUons for ""float"", while OALD has 10 We tend to be unable to find the specific sense m going from W3 to OALD, because at is likely that we have many more specific defimtlons that are not present In the other direction, we are hkely to have considerable ambiguity and multiple assignments W3-OALD OALD-W3 W3 OALD 120 78 60 18 99 34 60 07 32 86 34 A Between W3 and AHD, there ss less overall daspanty between the defimtaon sets, although since W3 Is tmabndged, we stall have a relatavely lugh number of senses m W3 that do not appear to be present m AHD Finally, It should be noted that the scores for the published dictaonanes tend to be a little lower than for WordNet and Hector Tlus reflects the hkehhood that we have not extracted as much mformataon as we dad m parsing and analyzmg the defimtaon sets used m Senseval W3 AHD oJ  'q O W3-AHD 120 115 40 36 90 AHD-W3 6 2 9 1 1 2 4 1 9 1 We next considered Dorr's lexacal database We first transformed her theta grids to syntactic spectflcataons (transttave or lntransmttve) and identtficataon of semreis (e g, where she Identified an instr component, we added such a semrel to the DIMAP sense) We were able to identify a mappmg from WordNet to her senses for two words (""float"" and ""shake"") for wluch Dorr has several entries However, smce she has considerably more semanuc components than we are currently able to recogmze, we dad not pursue this avenue any further at flus time More important than just mappmg between two words, Dorr's data mdacates the posstbday of further exploitation of a richer set of semanUc components Spectfically, as reported m (Olsen, et al, 1998), m descnbmg procedures for automatically acqumng thematic grids for Mandann Chinese, ~t was noted that ""verbs that incorporate themaUc elements m their meamng would not allow that element to appear m the complement structure"" Thus, by usmg Dorr's thematic grids when verb are parsed m defimtaons, it ~s possible to ~dentffy where partacular semantac components are lexicahzed and which others are transnutted through to the themaUc grid (complement or subcategonzataon pattern) for the defimendum The transmiss~on of semantic components to the thematic gnd ~s also reflected overtly m many defimtlons For example, shake has one definition, ""to bnng to a specified condatton by or as ffby repeated qmck jerky movements"" We would thus expect that the thematac grid for this defimtaon should include a ""goal"" And, deed, Dorr's database has two senses whch reqmre a ""goal"" as part of their thematic grid Smularly, for many defimtaons m the sample set, we ~dentLfied a source defimng pattern based on the word ""from,"" frequently, the object of the preposmon was the word ""source"" ttseff, mdacatmg that the subcategonzaUon, properties of the defimendum should elude a source component Discussion Wlule the improvement m mapping by using the componentaal analysis techmque (over the word overlap methods) is modest, we consider these results qmte slgmficant m wew of the very small number of defimng patterns we have Implemented Most of the improvement stems from the word substatuUon pnnclple described earlier (as ewdenced by the preponderance of 5 point scores) This techmque also provides a mechamsm for bnngmg back the stop words, wz, the preposmons, wluch are the careers of mformatmn about semrels (the 2 point scores) The more general conclusion (from the word subsutuuon) is that the success arises from no longer considenng a defimtmn m ~solation The proper context for a word and its defimtions consists not .lUSt of the words that make up the definition, but also the total semantac network represented by the dictaonary We have aclueved our results by explomng only a small part of that network We have moved only a few steps to that network beyond the mdawdual words and their definitions We would expect that further expansmn, first by the addon of further and ~mproved semrel defining patterns, and second, through the identaficataon of more pnmmve semanuc components, will add considerably to our abflay to map between lexacal resources We also expect ~mprovements from consideration of other techniques, such as attempts at ontology ahgnment (Hovy, 1998) Although tile definition analysis provlded here was performed on definmons with a stogie language, the vanous meamng components m m m m m m m m 35 correspond to those used in an Interhngua The use of the exUncuon method (developed m order to charactenze verbs m another language, Clunese) can frmtfully be applied here as well Two further observaUons about tlus process can be made The first is that rchance on a wellestablished semantic network such as WordNet,s not necessary The componenUal analysis method rehes on the local neighborhood of words m the defimUons, not on the completeness of the network Indeed, the network ~tsel can be bootstrapped based on the parsing results The method can work vath any semanUc network or ontology and may be used to refine or flesh out the network or ontology The second observation is that it is not necessary to have a well-estabhshed ""gold standard"" Any mapping vail do All that Is necessary is for any mvesugator (lemcographer or not) to create a judgmental mappmg The methods employed here can then quanufy ttus mapping based on a word overlap analysis and then further examine tt based on the componenaal analysis The componenUal analysis method can then be used to exanune underlying subtleUes and nuances tn the defimUous, wluch a lemcographer or analyst can then examine m further detail to assess the mapping Future Work Tlus work has marked the first ume that all the necessary mfrastructure has been combmed tn a rudimentary form Because of its rudimentary status, the opportumUes for improvement are quite extensive In addlUon, there are many opportumUes for using the techmques descnbed here m further NLP apphcatlons First, the techmques described here have immediate apphcabtllty as part of a lexicographer's workstaUon When defimUons are parsed and semrels are zdenttfied, the resulUng data structures can be apphed against a corpus of instances for parUcular words (as m Senseval) for improving word-sense disamblguaUon The techmques will also permit comparing an entry vath Itself to deternune the mterrelattonshtps among ~ts defimUons and of companng the defimUons of two ""synonyms"" to deternune the amount of overlap between them on a defimtlon by defimUon bas~s Although the analys,s here has focused on the parsing of defimUous, the development of defimng patterns clearly extends to generalized text parsing since the defimng patterns have been incorporated mto the same chcttonary used for parsing free text, the patterns can be used threctly to identify the presence of parUcular semrels among sentenual consUtuents We are working to integrate th~s funcUonahty into our word-sense &sambiguaUon techruques (both the defimng patterns and the semrels) Even further, mt seems that matclung defimng patterns in free text can be used for lextcal acquisition Textual matenal that contains these patterns could concewably be flagged as providing defimUonal matenal which can then be compared to emstmg defimUons to assess whether their use ts cous,stent vath these defimUons, and ff not, at least to flag the inconsistency The tecluuques descnbed here can be apphed directly to the fields of ontology development and analysis of ternunologlcal databases For ontoiogles, vath or w~thout defimuons, the methods employed can be used to compare entries m dai'erent ontologles based pnmanly on the relattous m the ontology, both luerarclucal and other For ternunologlcal databases, the methods descnbed here can be used to exanune the set of conceptual relaUons lmphed by the defimtmus The defimuon parsing wall facd~tate the development of the termmolog~ca I network tn the pamcular field covered by the database The componenUal analysts methods result m a richer semantic network that can be used m other apphcattous Thus, for example, ~t ts possible to extend the leracal chatmng methods described m (Green, 1997), which are based on the semrels used m WordNet The semrels developed with the componenttal analysis method would provide additional detad available for apphcauon of lexlcal cohesion methods In particular, addtUonal relattous would penmt some structunng wmthm the individual leracal chams, rather than just consldenng each cham as an amorphous set (Green, 1999) Finally, we are currently investigating the use of the componenUal analysts techmque for mformauon extracUon The techmque identifies (from defimtlous) slots that can be used as slots or fields m template generataon Once these slots are identified, we wall be attemptmg to extract slot values from Items m large catalog databases (mdhons of items) 36 In conclusion, it would seem that, instead of a paucity of tnformation allovang us to compare lexmal resources, by bnngmg m the full semantic network of the lexicon, we are overwhelmed with a plethora of data Acknowledgments I would like to thank Bonnie Dorr, Chnstiane

lexicographers taggrog the word senses (Kllgamff, 1998c, Kllgarnff, 1998a, Kflgarrlff, 1998b) 2 A Case Study In this-paper, we examine the ~ssue of raterannotator agreement by comparing the agreement rate of human annotators on a large sense-tagged corpus of more than 30,000 instances of the most frequently occurring nouns and verbs of Enghsh This corpus is the intersection of the WORDNET Semcor corpus (Miller et al, 1993) and the DSO corpus (Ng and Lee, 1996, Ng, 1997), which has been independently tagged wlth the refined senses of WORDNET by two separate groups of human annotators The Semcor corpus us a subset of the Brown corpus tagged with ~VoRDNET senses, and consists of more than 670,000 words from 352 text files Sense taggmg was done on the content words (nouns, ~erbs, adjectives and adverbs) m this subset The DSO corpus consists of sentences drawn from the Brown corpus and the Wall Street Journal For each word w from a hst of 191 frequently occurring words of Enghsh (121 nouns and 70 verbs), sentences containing w (m singular or plural form, and m its various reflectional verb form) are selected and each word occurrence w ~s tagged w~th a sense from WoRDNET There ~s a total of about 192,800 sentences in the DSO corpus m which one word occurrence has been sense-tagged m each sentence The intersection of the Semcor corpus and the DSO corpus thus consists of Brown corpus sentences m which a word occurrence w is sense-tagged m each sentence, where w Is one of.the 191 frequently oc-,currmg English nouns or verbs Since this common pomon has been sense-tagged by two independent groups of human annotators, ~t serves as our data set for investigating inter-annotator agreement in this paper 3 Sentence Matching To determine the extent of inter-annotator agreement, the first step ~s to match each sentence m Semcor to its corresponding counterpart In the DSO corpus This step ~s comphcated by the following factors 1 Although the intersected portion of both corpora came from Brown corpus, they adopted different tokemzatmn convention, and segmentartan into sentences differed sometimes 2 The latest versmn of Semcor makes use of the senses from WORDNET 1 6, whereas the senses used m the DSO corpus were from WoRDNET 15 1 To match the sentences, we first converted the senses m the DSO corpus to those of WORDNET 1 6 We ignored all sentences m the DSO corpus m which a word is tagged with sense 0 or -1 (A word is tagged with sense 0 or -1 ff none of the given senses m WoRDNFT applies ) 4, sentence from Semcor is considered to match one from the DSO corpus ff both sentences are exactl) ldent~cal or ff the~ differ only m the pre~ence or absence of the characters "" (permd) or -' (hyphen) For each remaining Semcor sentence, taking into account word ordering, ff 75% or more of the words m the sentence match those in a DSO corpus sentence, then a potential match ~s recorded These i -kctua\[ly, the WORD~q'ET senses used m the DSO corpus were from a shght variant of the official WORDNE'I 1 5 release Th~s ssas brought to our attention after the pubhc release of the DSO corpus potential matches are then manually verffied to ensure that they are true matches and to ~eed out any false matches Using this method of matching, a total of 13,188 sentence-palrs contasnmg nouns and 17,127 sentence-pa~rs containing verbs are found to match from both corpora, ymldmg 30,315 sentences which form the intersected corpus used m our present study 4 The Kappa Statistic Suppose there are N sentences m our corpus where each sentence contains the word w Assume that w has M senses Let 4 be the number of sentences which are assigned identical sense b~ two human annotators Then a simple measure to quantify the agreement rate between two human annotators Is Pc, where Pc, = A/N The drawback of this simple measure is that it does not take into account chance agreement between two annotators The Kappa statistic a (Cohen, 1960) is a better measure of rater-annotator agreement which takes into account the effect of chance agreement It has been used recently w~thm computatmnal hngu~stlcs to measure raterannotator agreement (Bruce and Wmbe, 1998, Carletta, 1996, Veroms, 1998) Let Cj be the sum of the number of sentences which have been assigned sense 3 by annotator 1 and the number of sentences whmh have been assigned sense 3 by annotator 2 Then P~-P~ 1-P~ where M j=l and Pe measures the chance agreement between two annotators A Kappa ~alue of 0 indicates that the agreement is purely due to chance agreement, whereas a Kappa ~alue of 1 indicates perfect agreement A Kappa ~alue of 0 8 and above is considered as mdmatmg good agreement (Carletta, 1996) Table 1 summarizes the inter-annotator agreement on the mtersected corpus The first (becond) row denotes agreement on the nouns (xerbs), wh~le the lass row denotes agreement on all words combined The a~erage ~ reported m the table is a s~mpie average of the individual ~ value of each word The agreement rate on the 30,315 sentences as measured by P= is 57% This tallies with the figure reported ~n our earlier paper (Ng and Lee, 1996)

on the intersected corpus is not high, we would like to find out how the agreement rate would be affected if different sense classes were in use In this section, we present a greedy search algorithm that can automatmalb derive coarser sense classes based on the sense tags assigned by two human annotators The resulting derived coarse sense classes achmve a higher agreement rate but we still maintain as many of the original sense classes as possible The algorithm is given m Figure 1 The algorithm operates on a set of sentences where each sentence contains an occurrence of the word w whmh has been sense-tagged by two human annotators At each Iteration of the algorithm, tt finds the pair of sense classes Ct and Cj such that merging these two sense classes results in the highest t~ value for the resulting merged group of sense classes It then proceeds to merge Cz and C~ Thin process Is repeated until the ~ value reaches a satisfactory value ~,~t,~, which we set as 0 8 Note that this algorithm is also applicable to deriving any coarser set of classes from a refined set for any NLP tasks in which prior human agreement rate may not be high enough Such NLP tasks could be discourse tagging, speech-act categorization, etc 6 Results For each word w from the list of 121 nouns and 70 verbs, ~e applied the greedy search algorithm to each set of sentences in the intersected corpus contaming w For a subset of 95 words (53 nouns and 42 verbs), the algorithm was able to derive a coarser set of 2 or more senses for each of these 95 words such that the resulting Kappa ~alue reaches 0 8 or higher For the other 96 words, m order for the Kappa value to reach 0 8 or higher, the algorithm collapses all senses of the ~ord to a single (trivial) class Table 2 and 3 summarizes the results for the set of 53 nouns and 42 ~erbs, respectively Table 2 md~cates that before the collapse of sense classes, these 53 nouns have an average of 7 6 senses per noun There is a total of 5,339 sentences in the intersected corpus containing these nouns, of which 3,387 sentences were assigned the same sense by the two groups of human annotators The average Kappa statistic (computed as a simple average of the Kappa statistic of ~he mdlwdual nouns) is 0 463 After the collapse of sense classes by the greedy search algorithm, the average number of senses per noun for these 53 nouns drops to 40 Howe~er, the number of sentences which have been asmgned the same coarse sense by the annotators increases to 5,033 That is, about 94 3% of the sentences have been assigned the same coarse sense, and that the average Kappa statistic has improved to 0 862, mgmfymg high rater-annotator agreement on the derived coarse senses Table3 gl~es the analogous figures for the 42 verbs, agmn mdmatmg that high agreement is achieved on the coarse sense classes den~ed for verbs 7 Discussion Our findings on rater-annotator agreement for word sense tagging indicate that for average language users, it is quite dl~cult to achieve high agreement when they are asked to assign refned sense tags (such as those found in WORDNET) given only the scanty definition entries m the WORDNET dlctionary and a few or no example sentences for the usage of each word sense Thin observation agrees wlth that obtmned m a recent study done by (Veroms, 1998), where the agreement on sense-tagging by naive users was also not hlgh Thus It appears that an average language user is able to process language wlthout needing to perform the task of dlsamblguatmg word sense to a very fine-grained resolutmn as formulated m a tradltlonal dmtlonary In contrast, expert lexicographers tagged the ~ ord sense in the sentences used m the SENSEVAL exerclse, where high rater-annotator agreement was reported There are also fuller dlctlonary entries m the HECTOR dlctlonary used and more e<amples showing the usage of each word sense m HECTOR These factors are likely to have contributed to the difference in rater-annotator agreement observed m the three studies conducted We also examined the coarse sense classes derived by the greedy search algorithm Vv'e found some interesting groupings of coarse senses for nouns which ~e hst in Table 4 From Table 4, it is apparent that the greedy search algorithm can derive interesting groupings of word senses that correspond to human mtmtwe judgment of sense graz}.ulanty It Is clear that some of the disagreement between the two groups of human annotators can be attributed solely to the overly refined senses of WoRDNET As an example, there is a total Ii loop: let Ct,, C M denote the current M sense classes ~* +--oo for all z,3 such that 1 <, < 3 < M let C\[,,C~w_ 1 denote the resulting M 1 sense classes by mergmg C, and C 3 compute ~(C\[,, C~/_t) ff ~(C,, C~4_x) > ~*
