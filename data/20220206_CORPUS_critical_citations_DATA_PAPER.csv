3,Athar_2011,D08-1067,"For comparison purposes, we revisit a fully generative Bayesian model for unsupervised coreference resolution recently introduced by Haghighi and Klein (2007), discuss its potential weaknesses and consequently propose three modifications to their model (Section 3)."
4,Athar_2011,D08-1067,"For comparison purposes, we revisit Haghighi and Kleins (2007) fully-generative Bayesian model for unsupervised coreference resolution, discuss its potential weaknesses and consequently propose three modifications to their model."
5,Athar_2011,W03-0806,"For example, 10 million words of the American National Corpus (Ide et al., 2002) will have manually corrected POS tags, a tenfold increase over the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993), currently used for training POS taggers."
6,Athar_2011,C04-1005,"For example, the statistical word alignment in IBM translation models (Brown et al. 1993) can only handle word to word and multi-word to word alignments."
7,Athar_2011,P06-1096,"For example, we would like to know that if a (JJ, JJ) 7We also tried using word clusters (Brown et al., 1992) instead of POS but found that POS was more helpful."
8,Athar_2011,C08-1025,"The Zipfian nature of a text corpus results in PCFG parameters related to the properties of specific words being especially badly estimated. For instance, about 38% of verbs in the training sections of the Penn Treebank (PTB) (Marcus et al., 1993) occur only once – the lexical properties of these verbs (such as their most common subcategorization frames ) cannot be represented accurately in a model trained exclusively on the Penn Treebank."
10,Athar_2011,P04-3005,"For the results in this paper, we have used Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) instead of IBM Model 1 (Brown et al., 1993), since (Rogati and Yang, 2004) found it to be as effective on Springer, but faster to compute."
11,Athar_2011,W06-1615,"For unknown words, SCL gives a relative reduction in error of 19.5% over Ratnaparkhi (1996), even with 40,000 sentences of source domain training data."
12,Athar_2011,J90-4003,"Formal complexity analysis has not been carried out, but my algorithm is simpler, at least conceptually, than the variable-word-order parsers of Johnson (1985), Kashket (1986), and Abramson and Dahl (1989)."
13,Athar_2011,P07-1108,"For statistical machine translation (SMT), phrase-based methods (Koehn et al., 2003; Och and Ney, 2004) and syntax-based methods (Wu, 1997; Alshawi et al. 2000; Yamada and Knignt, 2001; Melamed, 2004; Chiang, 2005; Quick et al., 2005; Mellebeek et al., 2006) outperform word-based methods (Brown et al., 1993)."
14,Athar_2011,D09-1014,"Furthermore, we provide a 63.8% error reduction compared to IBM Model 4 (Brown et al., 1993)."
15,Athar_2011,P04-3019,"Hanks and Church (1990) proposed using pointwise mutual information to identify collocations in lexicography; however, the method may result in unacceptable collocations for low-count pairs."
17,Athar_2011,D09-1057,"However, due to the lack of a fine grained NER tool at hand, we employ the Stanford NER package (Finkel et al., 2005) which identifies only four types of named entities."
18,Athar_2011,W09-0106,"However, it seems unrealistic to expect a one-size-fits-all approach to be achieve uniformly high performance across varied languages, and, in fact, it doesnt. Though the system presented in (Dasgupta and Ng, 2007) outperforms the best systems in the 2006 PASCAL challenge for Turkish and Finnish, it still does significantly worse on these languages than English (F-scores of 66.2 and 66.5, compared to 79.4)."
22,Athar_2011,P03-1055,"However, such constructions prove to be difficult for stochastic parsers (Collins et al., 1999) and they either avoid tackling the problem (Charniak, 2000; Bod, 2003) or only deal with a subset of the problematic cases (Collins, 1997)."
23,Athar_2011,N07-1057,"However, to what extent that assumption holds is tested only on a small number of language pairs using hand aligned data (Fox, 2002; Hwa et al., 2002; Wellington et al., 2006)."
24,Athar_2011,P09-1087,"Hierarchical approaches to machine translation have proven increasingly successful in recent years (Chiang, 2005; Marcu et al., 2006; Shen et al., 2008), and often outperform phrase-based systems (Och and Ney, 2004; Koehn et al., 2003) on target-language fluency and adequacy."
25,Athar_2011,N03-1028,"However, work in that direction has so far addressed only parse reranking (Collins and Duffy, 2002; Riezler et al., 2002)."
26,Athar_2011,I08-1068,"IBM Model1 (Brown et al., 1993) is a simplistic model which takes no account of the subtler aspects of language translation including the way word order tends to differ across languages."
27,Athar_2011,P06-2070,"If we consider these probabilities as a vector, the similarities of two English words can be obtained by computing the dot product of their corresponding vectors.2 The formula is described below: similarity(ei, ej) = Nsummationdisplay k=1 p(ei|fk)p(ej|fk) (3) Paraphrasing methods based on monolingual parallel corpora such as (Pang et al., 2003; Barzilay and Lee, 2003) can also be used to compute the similarity ratio of two words, but they dont have as rich training resources as the bilingual methods do."
28,Athar_2011,P06-1059,"In a recent study by Finkel et al., (2005), nonlocal information is encoded using an independence model, and the inference is performed by Gibbs sampling, which enables us to use a stateof-the-art factored model and carry out training efficiently, but inference still incurs a considerable computational cost."
29,Athar_2011,P08-1047,"In addition, the clustering methods used, such as HMMs and Browns algorithm (Brown et al., 1992), seem unable to adequately capture the semantics of MNs since they are based only on the information of adjacent words."
30,Athar_2011,P09-1059,"In addition, the performance of the adapted model for Joint S&T obviously surpass that of (Jiang et al., 2008), which achieves an F1 of 93.41% for Joint S&T, although with more complicated models and features."
31,Athar_2011,E09-1087,"In addition, the semi-supervised Morce performs (on single CPU and development data set) 77 times faster than the combination and 23 times faster than (Shen et al., 2007)."
32,Athar_2011,D07-1028,"In addition, uniform conditioning on mother grammatical function is more general than the case-phenomena specific generation grammar transform of (Cahill and van Genabith, 2006), in that it applies to each and every sub-part of a recursive input f-structure driving generation, making available relevant generation history (context) to guide local generation decisions."
33,Athar_2011,D09-1054,"In comparison, the 2D model in Figure 2(c) used in previous work (Ding et al., 2008) can only model the interaction between adjacent questions."
34,Athar_2011,W09-0407,"In contrast to existing approaches (Jayaraman and Lavie, 2005; Rosti et al., 2007), the context of the whole corpus rather than a single sentence is considered in this iterative, unsupervised procedure, yielding a more reliable alignment."
35,Athar_2011,W05-0829,"In recent years, various phrase translation approaches (Marcu and Wong, 2002; Och et al., 1999; Koehn et al., 2003) have been shown to outperform word-to-word translation models (Brown et al., 1993)."
36,Athar_2011,D09-1037,"In contrast, standard phrase-based models (Koehn et al., 2003) assume a mostly monotone mapping between source and target, and therefore cannot adequately model these phenomena."
37,Athar_2011,P05-1038,"In general, these authors have found that existing lexicalized parsing models for English (e.g., Collins 1997) do not straightforwardly generalize to new languages; this typically manifests itself in a severe reduction in parsing performance compared to the results for English."
39,Athar_2011,P09-1022,"In Owczarzak (2008), the method achieves equal or higher correlations with human judgments than METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005), one of the best-performingautomaticMTevaluationmetrics."
40,Athar_2011,J03-4003,"In particular, the model in Collins (1997) failed to generate punctuation, a deficiency of the model."
41,Athar_2011,P07-1090,"In pursuit of better translation, phrase-based models (Och and Ney, 2004) have significantly improved the quality over classical word-based models (Brown et al., 1993)."
42,Athar_2011,P09-1036,"In such a process, original phrase-based decoding (Koehn et al., 2003) does not take advantage of any linguistic analysis, which, however, is broadly used in rule-based approaches."
45,Athar_2011,W06-1650,"In the thriving area of research on automatic analysis and processing of product reviews (Hu and Liu 2004; Turney 2002; Pang and Lee 2005), little attention has been paid to the important task studied here assessing review helpfulness."
46,Athar_2011,W06-1628,"Phrase-based approaches (Och and Ney, 2004) to statistical machine translation (SMT) have recently achieved impressive results, leading to significant improvements in accuracy over the original IBM models (Brown et al., 1993)."
47,Athar_2011,W08-1406,"In what concerns the evaluation process, although ROUGE (Lin, 2004) is the most common evaluation metric for the automatic evaluation of summarization, since our approach might introduce in the summary information that it is not present in the original input source, we found that a human evaluation was more adequate to assess the relevance of that additional information."
48,Athar_2011,C08-2026,"Inside-out alignments (Wu, 1997), such as the one in Example 1.3, cannot be induced by any of these theories; in fact, there seems to be no useful synchronous grammar formalisms available that handle inside-out alignments, with the possible exceptions of synchronous tree-adjoining grammars (Shieber and Schabes, 1990), Bertsch and Nederhof (2001) and generalized multitext grammars (Melamed et al., 2004), which are all way more complex than ITG, STSG and (2,2)-BRCG."
51,Athar_2011,W06-3106,"It has the advantage of naturally capturing local reorderings and is shown to outperform word-based machine translation (Koehn et al., 2003)."
52,Athar_2011,P99-1067,It is faster and more mnemonic than the one in Dunning (1993).
53,Athar_2011,J02-4005,"Jing and McKeown (2000) have proposed a rule-based algorithm for sentence combination, but no results have been reported."
54,Athar_2011,N06-2051,"Lexical relationships under the standard IBM models (Brown et al., 1993) do not account for many-to-many mappings, and phrase extraction relies heavily on the accuracy of the IBM word-toword alignment."
55,Athar_2011,N07-1022,"Like WASP1, the phrase extraction algorithm of PHARAOH is based on the output of a word alignment model such as GIZA++ (Koehn et al., 2003), which performs poorly when applied directly to MRLs (Section 3.2)."
56,Athar_2011,W05-0708,"Many approaches for POS tagging have been developed in the past, including rule-based tagging (Brill, 1995), HMM taggers (Brants, 2000; Cutting and others, 1992), maximum-entropy models (Rathnaparki, 1996), cyclic dependency networks (Toutanova et al., 2003), memory-based learning (Daelemans et al., 1996), etc. All of these approaches require either a large amount of annotated training data (for supervised tagging) or a lexicon listing all possible tags for each word (for unsupervised tagging)."
57,Athar_2011,D09-1040,"Phrase-based systems, flat and hierarchical alike (Koehn et al., 2003; Koehn, 2004b; Koehn et al., 2007; Chiang, 2005; Chiang, 2007), have achieved a much better translation coverage than wordbased ones (Brown et al., 1993), but untranslated words remain a major problem in SMT."
58,Athar_2011,P05-3026,"METEOR was chosen since, unlike the more commonly used BLEU metric (Papineni et al., 2002), it provides reasonably reliable scores for individual sentences."
59,Athar_2011,W09-1802,"Methods like McDonalds, including the wellknown Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) algorithm (Goldstein et al., 2000), are subject to another problem: Summary-level redundancy is not always well modeled by pairwise sentence-level redundancy."
60,Athar_2011,J05-1003,"More recent work (McCallum 2003; Zhou et al. 2003; Riezler and Vasserman 2004) has considered methods for speeding up the feature selection methods described in Berger, Della Pietra, and Della Pietra (1996), Ratnaparkhi (1998), and Della Pietra, Della Pietra, and Lafferty (1997)."
61,Athar_2011,N06-1015,"Moreover, the parameters of the model must be estimated using averaged perceptron training (Collins, 2002), which can be unstable."
62,Athar_2011,E09-1087,"Most recently, (Suzuki and Isozaki, 2008) published their Semi-supervised sequential labelling method, whose results on POS tagging seem to be optically better than (Shen et al., 2007), but no significance tests were given and the tool is not available for download, i.e. for repeating the results and significance testing."
63,Athar_2011,D07-1055,"Note that the minimum error rate training (Och, 2003) uses only the target sentence with the maximum posterior probability whereas, here, the whole probability distribution is taken into account."
65,Athar_2011,W00-1308,One conclusion that we can draw is that at present the additional word features used in Ratnaparkhi (1996) looking at words more than one position away from the current do not appear to be helping the overall performance of the models.
66,Athar_2011,W09-2501,"One prominent constraint of the IBM word alignment models (Brown et al., 1993) is functional alignment, that is each target word is mapped onto at most one source word."
68,Athar_2011,P06-1077,"Phrase-based translation models (Marcu and Wong, 2002; Koehn et al., 2003; Och and Ney, 2004), which go beyond the original IBM translation models (Brown et al., 1993) by modeling translations of phrases rather than individual words, have been suggested to be the state-of-theart in statistical machine translation by empirical evaluations."
69,Athar_2011,W94-0106,"Other statistical systems that address word classification problems do not emphasize the use of linguistic knowledge and do not deal with a specific word class [Brown et al., 1992 ], or do not exploit as much linguistic knowledge as we do [Pereira et al., 1993]."
70,Athar_2011,E09-1048,"Our approach not only outperformed a notoriously difficult baseline but also achieved similar performance to the approach of (Svore et al., 2007), without requiring their third-party data resources."
71,Athar_2011,H05-1050,"Our experiments on the Canadian Hansards show that our unsupervised technique is significantly more effective than picking seeds by hand (Yarowsky, 1995), which in turn is known to rival supervised methods."
73,Athar_2011,D09-1054,"Our graphical representation has two advantages over previous work (Ding et al., 2008): unifying sentence relations and incorporating question interactions."
74,Athar_2011,P06-1124,"Our interpretation is more useful than past interpretations involving marginal constraints (Kneser and Ney, 1995; Chen and Goodman, 1998) or maximum-entropy models (Goodman, 2004) as it can recover the exact formulation of interpolated Kneser-Ney, and actually produces superior results."
75,Athar_2011,P98-2124,"Our method is a natural extension of those proposed in (Brown et al., 1992) and (Li and Abe, 1996), and overcomes their drawbacks while retaining their advantages."
76,Athar_2011,W07-0714,"Our method, extending this line of research with the use of labelled LFG dependencies, partial matching, and n-best parses, allows us to considerably outperform Liu and Gildea?s (2005) highest correlations with human judgement (they report 0.144 for the correlation with human fluency judgement, 0.202 for the correlation with human overall judgement), although it has to be kept in mind that such comparison is only tentative, as their correlation is calculated on a different test set."
77,Athar_2011,W08-1112,"Our model improves the baseline provided by (Cahill and van Genabith, 2006): (i) accuracy is increased by creating a lexicalised PCFG grammar and enriching conditioning context with parent f-structure features; and (ii) coverage is increased by providing lexical smoothing and fuzzy matching techniques for rule smoothing."
79,Athar_2011,W07-0409,"Recent works in statistical machine translation (SMT) shows how phrase-based modeling (Och and Ney, 2000a; Koehn et al., 2003) significantly outperform the historical word-based modeling (Brown et al., 1993)."
80,Athar_2011,D09-1161,Our study also shows that the simulated-annealing algorithm (Kirkpatrick et al. 1983) is more effective 1552 than the perceptron algorithm (Collins 2002) for feature weight tuning.
82,Athar_2011,N09-1019,"Our system improves over the latent named-entity tagging in Haghighi and Klein (2007), from 61% to 87%."
83,Athar_2011,J05-4004,"Our system outperforms competing approaches, including the standard machine translation alignment models (Brown et al. 1993; Vogel, Ney, and Tillmann 1996) and the state-of-the-art Cut and Paste summary alignment technique (Jing 2002)."
84,Athar_2011,C08-1031,"Point-wise mutual information (PMI) is commonly used for computing the association of two terms (e.g., Turney 2002), which is defined as: nullnullnull null null,null null nullnullnull nullnullnullnull,nullnull nullnull null null null nullnullnullnullnull. However, we argue that PMI is not a suitable measure for our purpose."
85,Athar_2011,P08-1118,"Presently, there exist methods for learning oppositional terms (Marcu and Echihabi, 2002) and paraphrase learning has been thoroughly studied, but successfully extending these techniques to learn incompatible phrases poses difficulties because of the data distribution."
86,Athar_2011,C88-1026,"Previous literature on GB parsing (Wehrli, 1984; Sharp, 1985; Kashket, 1986; Kuhns, 1986; Abney, 1986) has not addressed the issue of implementation of the Binding theory) The present paper intends in part to fill this gap."
87,Athar_2011,D09-1054,"Previous work (Ding et al., 2008) performs the extraction of contexts and answers in multiple passes of the thread (with each pass corresponding to one question), which cannot address the interactions well."
88,Athar_2011,W00-1308,"Ratnaparkhi (1996: 134) suggests use of an approximation summing over the training data, which does not sum over possible tags: "" h E f j = 2 P( ~)p(ti l hi)f j(hi,ti) i=1. However, we believe this passage is in error: such an estimate is ineffective in the iterative scaling algorithm."
89,Athar_2011,J98-1004,"Regardless of whether it takes the form of dictionaries (Lesk 1986; Guthrie et al. 1991; Dagan, Itai, and Schwall 1991; Karov and Edelman 1996), thesauri (Yarowsky 1992; Walker and Amsler 1986), bilingual corpora (Brown et al. 1991; Church and Gale 1991), or hand-labeled training sets (Hearst 1991; Leacock, Towell, and Voorhees 1993; Niwa and Nitta 1994; Bruce and Wiebe 1994), providing information for sense definitions can be a considerable burden. What makes our approach unique is that, since we narrow the problem to sense discrimination, we can dispense of an outside source of knowledge for defining senses."
90,Athar_2011,D08-1089,"Statistical phrase-based systems (Och and Ney, 2004; Koehn et al., 2003) have consistently delivered state-of-the-art performance in recent machine translation evaluations, yet these systems remain weak at handling word order changes."
91,Athar_2011,P08-1002,"Secondly, while most pronoun resolution evaluations simply exclude non-referential pronouns, recent unsupervised approaches (Cherry and Bergsma, 2005; Haghighi and Klein, 2007) must deal with all pronouns in unrestricted text, and therefore need robust modules to automatically handle non-referential instances."
92,Athar_2011,P03-1013,"Section 5 presents an error analysis for Collinss (1997) lexicalized model, which shows that the head-head dependencies used in this model fail to cope well with the flat structures in Negra."
93,Athar_2011,D08-1024,"Sentence-level approximations to B exist (Lin and Och, 2004; Liang et al., 2006), but we found it most effective to perform B computations in the context of a set of previously-translated sentences, following Watanabe et al."
95,Athar_2011,W08-0404,"Several studies have shown that large-margin methods can be adapted to the special complexities of the task (Liang et al., 2006; Tillmann and Zhang, 2006; Cowan et al., 2006) . However, the capacity of these algorithms to improve over state-of-the-art baselines is currently limited by their lack of robust dimensionality reduction."
97,Athar_2011,W04-2708,"Since Czech is a language with relatively high degree of word-order freedom, and its sentences contain certain syntactic phenomena, such as discontinuous constituents (non-projective constructions), which cannot be straightforwardly handled using the annotation scheme of Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993; Linguistic Data Consortium, 1999), based on phrase-structure trees, we decided to adopt for the PCEDT the dependency-based annotation scheme of the Prague Dependency Treebank PDT (Linguistic Data Consortium, 2001)."
99,Athar_2011,N06-1013,"stance, the IBM models (Brown et al., 1993) can be improved by adding more context dependencies into the translation model using a ME framework rather than using only p(f j |e i ) (Garcia-Varea et al., 2002)."
100,Athar_2011,W04-2003,"Statistical disambiguation such as (Collins and Brooks, 1995) for PP-attachment or (Collins, 1997; Charniak, 2000) for generative parsing greatly improve disambiguation, but as they model by imitation instead of by understanding, complete soundness has to remain elusive."
101,Athar_2011,W09-2301,"The dominance of traditional phrase-based statistical machine translation (PBSMT) models (Koehn et al., 2003) has recently been challenged by the development and improvement of a number of new models that explicity take into account the syntax of the sentences being translated."
102,Athar_2011,D08-1016,"String alignment with synchronous grammars is quite expensive even for simple synchronous formalisms like ITG (Wu, 1997) but Duchi et al. show how to incorporate bipartite matching into max-product BP"
103,Athar_2011,D07-1080,"Such a quasi-syntactic structure can naturally capture the reordering of phrases that is not directly modeled by a conventional phrase-based approach (Koehn et al., 2003)."
104,Athar_2011,P04-1037,"Supervised approaches which make use of a small hand-labeled training set (Bruce and Wiebe, 1994; Yarowsky, 1993) typically outperform unsupervised approaches (Agirre et al., 2000; Litkowski, 2000; Lin, 2000; Resnik, 1997; Yarowsky, 1992; Yarowsky, 1995), but tend to be tuned to a specific corpus and are constrained by scarcity of labeled data."
106,Athar_2011,P06-2122,"Synchronous grammar formalisms that are capable of modeling such complex relationships while maintaining the context-free property in each language have been proposed for many years, (Aho and Ullman, 1972; Wu, 1997; Yamada and Knight, 2001; Melamed, 2003; Chiang, 2005), but have not been scaled to large corpora and long sentences until recently."
107,Athar_2011,W07-1429,"Table 2: Figures about clustering algorithms Algorithm # Sentences/# Clusters S-HAC 6,23 C-HAC 2,17 QT 2,32 EM 4,16 In fact, table 2 shows that most of the clusters have less than 6 sentences which leads to question the results presented by (Barzilay & Lee, 2003) who only keep the clusters that contain more than 10 sentences."
108,Athar_2011,D09-1009,"The 74.6% final accuracy on apartments is higher than any result obtained by Haghighi and Klein (2006) (the highest is 74.1%), higher than the supervised HMM results reported by Grenager et al."
109,Athar_2011,P98-2234,"The 75.4% results may seen low compared to parsing results like the 88% precision and recall in (Collins, 1997), but those parsing results include many easier-to-parse constructs."
110,Athar_2011,N03-1019,"The ATTM attempts to overcome the deficiencies of word-to-word translation models (Brown et al., 1993) through the use of phrasal translations."
112,Athar_2011,E06-1012,"Collins et al. (1999) applied the parser of Collins (1997) developed for English, to Czech, and found that the performance was substantially lower when compared to the results for English."
113,Athar_2011,P09-1088,"The field of machine translation has seen many advances in recent years, most notably the shift from word-based (Brown et al., 1993) to phrase-based models which use token n-grams as translation units (Koehn et al., 2003)."
115,Athar_2011,E09-1087,"The combination is significantly better than (Shen et al., 2007) at a very high level, but more importantly, Shens results (currently representing the replicable state-of-the-art in POS tagging) have been significantly surpassed also by the semisupervised Morce (at the 99 % confidence level)."
116,Athar_2011,D07-1027,"The evaluation shows that our algorithm considerably outperforms (Cahill et al., 2004)s with respect to Chinese data."
117,Athar_2011,D09-1038,"The experimental results show that our method outperforms the synchronous binarization method (Zhang et al., 2006) with over 0.8 BLEU scores on both NIST 2005 and NIST 2008 Chinese-to-English evaluation data sets."
118,Athar_2011,N03-1028,"The generalized perceptron proposed by Collins (2002) is closely related to CRFs, but the best CRF training methods seem to have a slight edge over the generalized perceptron."
119,Athar_2011,W93-0301,"The method was intended as a replacement for sentence-based methods (e.g., (Brown et al., 1991a; Gale and Church, 1991b; Kay and Rosenschein, 1993)), which are very sensitive to noise."

121,Athar_2011,N07-1006,"The most commonly used metric, BLEU, correlates well over large test sets with human judgments (Papineni et al., 2002), but does not perform as well on sentence-level evaluation (Blatz et al., 2003)."
123,Athar_2011,E09-1043,"The problem is typically presented in log-space, which simplifies computations, but otherwise does not change the problem due to the monotonicity of the log function (hm = log hprimem) log p(t|s) = summationdisplay m m hm(t,s) (3) Phrase-based models (Koehn et al., 2003) are limited to the mapping of small contiguous chunks of text."

125,Athar_2011,P06-1096,"The process of phrase extraction is difficult to optimize in a non-discriminative setting: many heuristics have been proposed (Koehn et al., 2003), but it is not obvious which one should be chosen for a given language pair."
126,Athar_2011,W93-0301,"The program takes the output of char_align (Church, 1993), a robust alternative to sentence-based alignment programs, and applies word-level constraints using a version of Brown el al.'s Model 2 (Brown et al., 1993), modified and extended to deal with robustness issues."
127,Athar_2011,P06-1141,"The simplicity of our approach makes it easy to incorporate dependencies across the whole corpus, which would be relatively much harder to incorporate in approaches like (Bunescu and Mooney, 2004) and (Finkel et al., 2005)."
128,Athar_2011,W06-3122,"The size of the development set used to generate 1 and 2 (1000 sentences) compensates the tendency of the unsmoothed MERT algorithm to overfit (Och, 2003) by providing a high ratio between number of variables and number of parameters to be estimated."
130,Athar_2011,P07-1090,"The utility of ITG as a reordering constraint for most language pairs, is well-known both empirically (Zens and Ney, 2003) and analytically (Wu, 1997), however ITG’s straight (monotone) and inverted (reverse) rules exhibit strong cohesiveness, which is inadequate to express orientations that require gaps."
131,Athar_2011,P98-1006,"The work reported in Wu (1997), which uses an inside-outside type of training algorithm to learn statistical contextfree transduction, has a similar motivation to the current work, but the models we describe here, being fully lexical, are more suitable for direct statistical modelling."

135,Athar_2011,W07-0719,"Translations tables in Phrase-based Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) are often built on the basis of Maximum-likelihood Estimation (MLE), being one of the major limitations of this approach that the source sentence context in which phrases occur is completely ignored (Koehn et al., 2003)."

184,Athar_2011,P04-1013,"While both (Johnson, 2001) and (Klein and Manning, 2002) propose models which use the parameters of the generative model but train to optimize a discriminative criteria, neither proposes training algorithms which are computationally tractable enough to be used for broad coverage parsing."
186,Athar_2011,W08-0404,"While minimum error training (Och, 2003) has by now become a standard tool for interpolating a small number of aggregate scores, it is not well suited for learning in high-dimensional feature spaces."

212,Athar_2011,W06-3601,"It is helpful to compare this approach with recent efforts in statistical MT. Phrase-based models (Koehn et al., 2003; Och and Ney, 2004) are good at learning local translations that are pairs of (consecutive) sub-strings, but often insufficient in modeling the reorderings of phrases themselves, especially between language pairs with very different word-order."

Ribas (1994) presented an approach which takes into account the syntactic position of the elements whose semantic relation is to be acquired. However, those and most of the following approaches require as a prerequisite a fixed taxonomy of semantic relations. This is a problem because (i) entailment hierarchies are presently available for few languages, and (ii) we regard it as an open question whether and to what degree existing designs for lexical hierarchies are appropriate for representing lexical meaning."

237,Concit,W09-3603,"Table 5 presents the subtractive analysis to determine the impact of different feature types. From this we can see that the n-grams (unigrams and bi-grams) have by far the largest impact - and neither of these feature types was directly implemented by Teufel and Moens (2002). The next most important features are the first few words (again a unigram type feature), length and the section number. The Markov history features also have an impact of just over 1%."

Most of these tools have focussed on entity recognition and relation extraction and with few exceptions, e.g., (Hyland, 1996; Light et al., 2004; Sandor, 2007; Vincze et al., 2008), do not take into account the discourse context of the knowledge extracted.

However, their dataset consists of only 10 papers and their annotation scheme differs from our four-class annotation as they do not deal with any sentiment."
267,Concit,C12-1075,"For supervised methods, summarization is often regarded as a classification task or a sequence labeling task at sentence level, and many supervised learning algorithms have been investigated including Hidden Markov Models (Conroy and O'leary, 2001), Support Vector Regression (You et al., 2011), Factor Graph Model (Yang et al., 2011), etc. However, such a supervised learning paradigm often requires a large amount of labeled data, which are not available in most cases."

270,Concit,C12-1075,"In this case, existing tag-based summarization methods will fail to produce a personalized summary (Boydell and Smyth, 2007; Zhu et al., 2009), since the user-related tags may be absent for that document."
272,Concit,L14-1027,"We also experimented with statistical ranking algorithms, such as the ranking SVM (Joachims, 2002), but the result was unstable, because currently we can only obtain a very small number of training examples for statistical rerankers."
273,Concit,P09-1027,"Though pilot studies have been performed to make use of English corpora for subjectivity classification in other languages (Mihalcea et al., 2007; Banea et al., 2008), the methods are very straightforward by directly employing an inductive classifier (e.g. SVM, NB), and the classification performance is far from satisfactory because of the language gap between the original language and the translated language."
274,Concit,P09-1027,"The above two methods have been used in (Banea et al., 2008) for Romanian subjectivity analysis, but the experimental results are not very promising."
275,Concit,C04-1071,"This means that the approach for SA should be switched from the rather shallow analysis techniques used for text mining (Hearst, 1999; Nasukawa and Nagano, 2001), where some errors can be treated as noise, into deep analysis techniques such as those used for machine translation (MT) where all of the syntactic and semantic phenomena must be handled."
277,Concit,W12-4303,"State-of-the-art citations identification mechanisms focus either on detecting explicit citations i.e. those that consist of either the author names and the year of publication or bracketed numbers only, or include a small sentence window around the explicit citation as input text (Councill et al., 2008; Radev et al., 2009; Ritchie et al., 2008). The assumption behind this approach is that all related mentions of the paper would be concentrated in the immediate vicinity of the anchor text. However, this assumption does not generally hold true (Teufel, 2010; Sugiyama et al., 2010)."
279,Athar_2011,N06-1058,"This can explain why previous attempts to use WordNet for generating sentence-level paraphrases (Barzilay and Lee, 2003; Quirk et al., 2004) were unsuccessful."
280,Concit,W12-4303,"Current work on citation sentiment detection works under the assumption that the sentiment present in the citation sentence represents the true sentiment of the author towards the cited paper (Athar, 2011; Piao et al., 2007; Pham and Hoffmann, 2004). This assumption is so dominant because current citation identification methods (Councill et al., 2008; Ritchie et al., 2008; Radev et al., 2009) can readily identify the citation sentence, whereas it is much harder to determine the relevant context. However, this assumption most certainly does not hold true when the citation context spans more than one sentence."
281,Concit,W12-4303,"Church et al. (1989), Wettler & Rapp (1989) and Church & Hanks (1990) describe algorithms which do this. However, the validity of these algorithms has not been tested by systematic comparisons with associations ofhuman subjects."
283,Concit,W12-4303,"A common approach for sentiment detection is to use a labelled lexicon to score sentences (Hatzivas-siloglou and McKeown, 1997; Turney, 2002; Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003). However, such approaches have been found to be highly topic dependent (Engstrom, 2004; Gamon and Aue, 2005; Blitzer et al., 2007), which makes the creation of a general sentiment classifier a difficult task."
285,Concit,W12-4303,"Some other recent work has focused on the problem of implicit citation extraction (Kaplan et al., 2009; Qazvinian and Radev, 2010). Kaplan et al. (2009) explore co-reference chains for citation extraction using a combination of co-reference resolution techniques (Soon et al., 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002). However, the corpus that they use consists of only 94 citations to 4 papers and is likely to be too small to be representative."
286,Concit,W12-4303,"For citation extraction, the most relevant work is by Qazvinian and Radev (2010) who proposed a framework of Markov Random Fields to extract only the non-explicit citations for a given paper. They model each sentence as a node in a graph and experiment with various window boundaries to create edges between neighbouring nodes weighted by lexical similarity between nodes. However, their dataset consists of only 569 citations from 10 papers and their annotation scheme deals with neither acronyms nor sentiment."
287,Concit,W07-1530,"An implementation of the extant sdrt (Asher and Lascarides, 2003) glue logic for building discourse structures is insufficient to deal with open domain text,"
288,Concit,W07-1530,"It has been difficult to identify all and only those cases where a token functions as a discourse connective, and in many cases, the syntactic analysis in the Penn TreeBank (Marcus et al., 1993) provides no help."
292,Concit,W99-0311,"Researchers developing corpus resources for summarisation work have often defined their own gold standard, relying on their own intuitions (see, e.g. Luhn, 1958; Edmundson, 1969) or have used abstracts supplied by authors or by professional abstractors as their gold standard (e.g. Kupiec et al., 1995; Mani and Bloedorn, 1998). Neither approach is very satisfactory."
295,Concit,W99-0311,"This result is clearly in contrast to studies which conclude that humans are not very reliable at this kind of task (Rath et al., 1961). We attribute this difference to a difference in our instructions. Whereas the subjects in Rath et al.'s experiment were asked to look for the most relevant sentences, our annotators had to look for specific argumentative roles which seems to have eased the task. In addition, our guidelines give very specific instructions for ambiguous cases"
296,Concit,D13-1097,"Although the explanatory relation extraction task has been studied from the view of linguistic and discourse representation by existing works (Carston, 1993; Lascarides and Asher, 1993), the automatic extraction task is still an open question."

This study purported to supplement the diet of 64 COPD patients with an omega-3 PUFA or an omega-6 PUFA supplement for two years, and reported significant improvements in the omega-3 PUFA group in the 6 min walk test, perceived rate of exertion (Borg score) and arterial oxygen saturation (pulse oximetry (SpO2)). The study also reported a decrease in sputum cytokines (inflammatory regulators) in the group receiving omega-3 PUFA with no change in the omega-6 PUFA group. The study concluded that “nutritional support with an omega-3 PUFA-rich diet is a safe and practical method for treating COPD” [6].

But Cass usually constructs some different networks for the same dataset when it is input as different orders. The phylogenetic network constructed by Cass represents lots of redundant information except for the original information. Both factors considered it is obvious that Cass has poor practical application."

Interestingly, the endocytosed peptide-QDs accumulated within endosomes that were labelled with transferrin, a characteristic marker of early endosomes and the recycling pathway. Thus, one might wonder whether these small peptide-QDs are sorted into the recycling pathway rather than following the degradative pathway to lysosomes, and if some of the particles in the image may be bound to the cell surface following slow recycling."
