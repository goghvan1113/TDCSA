"Finally, we have the WNetSS semantic measures library introduced recently by Aouicha etÂ al.

As we mentioned previously in sectionÂ 1.1.1, the caching strategy used by WNetSS severely impacts its performance and scalability. In addition, WNetSS exhibits two other significant extensibility drawbacks which prevent its use for researching and prototyping of new methods, as follows: (1) the current distribution of WNetSS does not include its source files, thus, their architecture, representation model for taxonomies and implementation details are missing; and (2) the current WNetSS version does not allow any type of functional extension, such as including a new taxonomy parser, as well as a new semantic similarity library or IC model. Finally, despite one of the main motivations of WNetSS being to provide a software implementation for the most recent methods, looking at tablesÂ 2 and 3, you can see that WNetSS [15] neither implements nor cites many recent similarity measures and IC models reported in the literature.",Negative

"When comparing the effects of different information levels provided by the two graphs, we find that negotiation behavior becomes tougher. If negotiators are provided with the utilities of their opponent, then the visualization of offer-ratings according to the preferences of both negotiators makes it impossible to outwit the counterpart. The high level of control of both negotiation partners may actually act as a barrier to deceive the partner. Therefore, negotiators use more hard and soft tactics to substantiate their own position. At the same time, the negotiation dance graph may act as an ex-post monitoring system. When users make a concession, they can easily see whether their counterparts reciprocate, and the dance graph reduces the risk of being exploited. We observe that negotiators provided with the negotiation dance graph offer more unconditional concessions. The effect of these differences in behavior is visible in the quality of outcomes: in contrast to the history graph, the negotiation dance graph facilitates efficient and fair agreements. Nevertheless, it does not make negotiators more satisfied. On the contrary, their holistic assessment of the negotiation outcome is significantly lower compared to the negotiators who have no access to utility values of their opponent. This can be explained by the tougher negotiation process visible through the increased use of hard tactics and by the fact that negotiators compare their individual outcome with the opponent's outcome. Even a small difference in utilities might lead to the feeling of being a loser instead of a winner (e.g. [17,37,77]).",Negative

Therefore, the history graph shows the distance between the offers submitted and received based on the focal users' value function. The history graph is designed to enable users to assess how far they are from reaching an agreement. For example, company A and company B negotiate over a contract including several issues and refer to the history graph. When company A formulates an offer, the utility rating of the offer and consequently its graphical presentation is based on the preferences of company A. When company B analyzes the offer received from company A, company B is provided with a rating and a graphical display of the offer according to the ratings of company B. This implies that each transmitted offer is rated according to the focal user only, while the preferences of the counterpart are not taken into account in the rating of offers or in the graphical displays",Neutral

"Okutan and Cicekli [15] proposed an event calculus based web service composition and execution (WSCE) system. The system has two phases, namely composition phase and execution phase. In the composition phase, the OWLS process definitions are translated to axioms in event calculus domain. Web services are encoded as ac-tions, web service inputs and outputs as action’s knowledge pre-conditions and knowledge effects, and web service preconditions and effects as action preconditions and effects. The user inputs are substituted as initial condition axioms and the outputs as goals. Based on the domain knowledge, the Abductive Event Calculus Planner generates plans to reach the given goal state. The plans are presented to the user in the form of visual graphs, which can be sorted according to user’s quality of service parameter among execution duration, price, reliability and availability. In the execution phase, the selected graph is transformed to OWLS descriptions and passed to the execution engine. The user enters the actual input values, and the actual web services modelled by the OWLS pro-cesses are invoked.WSCE is a good effort to use event calculus for web service com-position. The main benefit of this system is that it supports concur-rent plans and so it is better suited for solving real world business scenarios.

"Tables represent information that is symbolic in nature. They present data in separable formats, which introduce single point values more accurately than other representation aids [12,31,67]. Results from various studies indicate that tables should be used to present information when decision makers are required to recall specific amounts, handle values accurately (e.g. [5,12,45]) or compare data [44]. Therefore, in conflict situations with high sensitivity to small deviations from the optimum, tabular reports can provide exact values that are more resistant to distortion in comparison with other forms of information representation [4,5]. Tables provide little integrative information. Any links between the single values displayed must be made by the decision makers since tables neither provide support for integrating the effects of a number of variables in one period of time, as schematic faces do, nor for showing the effects of one variable over more periods of time, as graphs do [67,79].

Conflict could be induced by varying the discussion issues and creating more integrative/conflicting bargaining settings. Users' performance could be observed by changing only external factors (in this case the bargaining situation in which negotiations are embedded). Variance in the number of issues involved in a case could also affect the end result. Another avenue of future research is the effect of additional information provided to users. The present study shows that the amount of information provided to negotiators leads to either more cooperative or more competitive behavior. Future studies should investigate the impact of different types of information implemented in different information displays. Considering the process of information gathering, future investigations also need to examine the effect of dynamic decision aids at different stages of decision making. A particular focus should be placed on the stages in which information is acquired and in which the information is evaluated. The issue of time duration of the experiment must be taken into account [51]. The effects of additional support provided by graphical aids are often seen as a trade-off between the benefits of minimizing errors and the cognitive effort or time needed in a particular task environment [22]. In the present study, there was an imposed time deadline for all users, thus the variable time was kept constant and all impacts could be considered only with regard to proxies for the quality of decisions. Raiffa [56] argues that a negotiation resembles a dance of negotiation partners. We have demonstrated with this study that there is no straight answer to the question “Shall we dance?” Rather the results suggest that the answer depends on the partners' aims (efficiency vs. fairness) quantitative vs. qualitative outcomes (utility vs. satisfaction), to dance or to skip the dance.",Neutral

"There is widely related work in the field of ontology engineering. Hartung et al.

Evolution mappings can be seen as diff models which comprise atomic as well as composite operations. Their goal is to produce a minimal diff model by using a rule-based system for minimizing the atomic operations by aggregating them to composite operations. The approach is tailored to an ontology language as well as to a small set of composite operations such as moving, splitting, and merging concepts by providing specific detection rules. Finally, they apply aggregation functions to further shrink down the size of the diff model by combining composite operations, which is in our approach supported by using iterations in the transformation rules.In summary, the presented approach of this paper is the first generic solution that allows the reuse of specifications for execution composite operations also for detecting applications of them. All other approaches are either based on operation tracking or they are restricted to a dedicated language and pre-defined composite operations, which have to be re-formulated as detection rules",Positive

"To answer the research questions, an electronic negotiation support system is required that supports business negotiations, rich communication support and various forms of decision support. Negoisst is a web-based NSS offering sophisticated support and formal document management [62,63]. Therefore, the experiments were conducted using Negoisst (see Fig. 4 for a screenshot of the system). Users negotiate via an electronic message exchange. The content of the messages is written in natural language (shown to the left of Fig. 4). In order to avoid misunderstandings and to prevent re-negotiations due to contractual ambiguities, Negoisst offers semantic and pragmatic enrichment. Semantic enrichment links free text to the negotiation agenda (shown to the right of Fig. 4). Pragmatic enrichment supports explicit intentions, because message types are indicated by the author (see Fig. 4). Negoisst also provides decision support. Negotiators specify their preferences on attributes to be negotiated and the system then computes a utility function. Each offer is rated, and both negotiators can see in a glance how well they have already achieved their goals. If a negotiator writes a message offering a certain package, then the system will calculate the utility immediately. The negotiator can check the utility value before sending the message. Negoisst automatically deduces a contract version from each message sent, as well as a message thread representing the reasons for the decisions taken. Users are able to check the contract versions as well as all exchanged messages at any time during the negotiations.",Neutral

"Alternatively, literature proposes the use of the negotiation dance graph [56]. In contrast to the history graph, the negotiation dance graph rates and visualizes each exchanged offer according to the real preferences of both negotiators, i.e. the history of offers is presented in the joint utility space (see Fig. 3). The negotiation dance graph presents preference information about the counterpart to the negotiators, thus providing significantly more information than the negotiation history graph. Operatively, each offer is rated on the ordinate according to the preferences of the focal negotiator, while on the horizontal axis the offer is rated according to the preferences of the counterpart. While in a single attribute negotiation, preference information can directly be inferred from the dance graph, this information is much more difficult to read in a multi-attribute negotiation. Nevertheless, by comparing several offers made by the negotiation partner, the negotiators can identify the counterpart's major trade-offs between attributes. Within an integrative negotiation approach, the knowledge of the counterpart's true preferences facilitates Pareto-improving negotiation moves and consequently efficient agreements [56]. Within a distributive negotiation setting, however, it bears the danger of being exploited by opportunistic and competitive negotiators. In the negotiation dance, the factor “time” is considered to be more implicit as all offers are numbered in chronological order and linked by spatial lines. The main difference between the history graph and the negotiation dance graph is that in the history graph calculations are made only on the basis of the focal user's preferences, whereas in the negotiation dance each rating is a function of utilities of both users.",Positive

Studies suggest that graphical decision aids are more efficient and lead to better performance when subjects face a higher cognitive load [45,58,70].

"Managers spend up to one fifth of their working time with conflict resolution and negotiation [15,63]. They increasingly negotiate via electronic media such as e-mail, e-meeting and e-negotiation systems [73]. Electronic negotiations are not mere translations of traditional negotiations onto electronic media, but rather they provide additional value by supporting the decision making and/or communication process [62,74]. Electronic negotiation support (eNS) is realized through information and communication technology and can range from a simple message exchange to a complex support system. A negotiation support system (NSS) comprises one or more of the following functionalities: facilitation of communication, decision/negotiation analysis support, process organization and structuring, and access to information, negotiation knowledge, experts, mediators or facilitators [26]. In this context, the representation of information (textual, graphical, and auditory) is important for human–computer interactions. Due to technical advances in the last decades, users can often rapidly and effectively choose from various formats of computer generated reports. We know from empirical evidence that the way information is presented strongly influences human perceptions, preferences and decision making (e.g. [5,76]).

"Other studies suggest a trade-off between the benefits of minimizing errors and the cognitive effort or time needed in a particular task environment [14]. When facing complex situations, decision makers use cognitive simplification strategies [15,61] and pursue a strategy of swapping effort in terms of time invested in the problem solution for accuracy [24]. The graphical organization of information influences the equation of this cost–benefit tradeoff by allowing the user to pursue an adequate strategy more easily than others. Jarvenpaa [22] introduces the term “incongruence” to describe a situation in which the processing required for a decision strategy and the process encouraged by the graphical tool are in conflict. Thus, the cost–benefit principle assumes that this incongruence results in additional costs for the user, increased effort or time or higher likelihood of mistakes. Dilla and Steibart [13] confirm that additional mental calculations increase the potential of making mistakes.",Positive
"A further advantage of the likelihood-based approach is that is easily extended: for example, selection algorithms may consider steps in which more than two nodes are merged.

"Complementing the cognitive fit theory, Paivio [48–50] proposes the dual coding theory. This suggests that human working memory encodes, organizes, stores and retrieves imagery and verbal information in two different ways. When retrieving, processing and reproducing information, cognitive activities are mediated by two independent yet interconnected cognitive subsystems in the human mind: An imagery system (specialized in the representation and processing of nonverbal objects in a sequential manner) and a verbal system (specialized in handling linguistic propositions using a parallel processing system). Both methods are functionally interconnected at the referential levels, so that an activity in one system can cause an activity in the other system. The visual argument approach asserts that graphical displays make less demands on human cognitive resources [34,59]. According to this theory, graphs enable users to extract information without engaging in deep processing by providing guidance, constraints and facilitations in cognitive processes.",Positive

The vast amount of information is not necessarily linked to more accurate and efficient decisions, but rather sometimes to “information overload” for a decision maker (e.g. [41,72]). Scientific interest also focuses on handling large amounts of information and on overcoming mental resource limitations and cognitive biases (e.g. [23,46]). These developments have led to the advancement of stylized decision aids that “represent the problem in a stylized way that capitalizes on some special human cognitive processing ability” [86, p. 46]. Traditional stylized decision aids are tables and graphs in the form of lines, scatter plots, bar charts, and animations [45]. These display formats have been used successfully to extend human processing abilities in decision making [34,78,79].

For example, in an app with NETWORK permission, a user can choose to enable/disable the corresponding functionality. The solution presented by Bartel etÂ al. (2012) follows the same direction.

"The paradigm of cognitive fit suggests that effective and efficient problem solving is obtained when all tools or aids used in the problem solving process correspond to the requirements of the task [78–80]. Problem solving is seen as an outcome of the relationship between problem presentation and the problem solving task. Cognitive processes act on the information presentation and the problem-solving task to provide a mental representation of the situation. The latter is the way the problem is represented in human working memory. When the types of information in the problem presentation match those in the task, the problem solver formulates a mental representation that is based on the same type of information. In contrast, a mismatch between the problem presentation and the task leads to a mental representation based only on the problem representation. The decision maker must then mentally transform the task into a suitable form, exerting additional cognitive efforts in order to solve a particular type of problem. Similarly, if a mental representation is formulated according to the task alone, the decision maker has to transform the data of the problem presentation into an appropriate form for the task solution. In both cases, additional cognitive capacities are required for auxiliary mental steps, which typically lead to poor results for the decision maker. The cognitive fit theory encourages the use of problem representations consistent with task requirements in order to improve the decision making process for those using decision aids",Neutral

"The cognitive fit theory and its complementary models (dual coding theory, visual argument approach and conjoint retention hypothesis) have received significant attention in empirical research. Several studies confirm the basic assumptions of the cognitive fit theory and propose further extensions. Speier and Morris [71] provide a study associating literature on graphical support and cognitive fit theory. They investigate the characteristics of query interfaces and show that visual interfaces provide a holistic perspective of the presented data. Along with Smelcer and Carmel [68], they extend the view of comparative advantages of graphical display formats by showing that the performance difference in terms of time and accuracy increases even with task complexity. The relationship between the level of information processing and environmental complexity has the shape of an inverted “U” [65], demonstrating that graphical aids allow users to gather more information prior to reaching the critical point of information overload. Free cognitive resources can be used elsewhere. A more recent Speier study [70] illustrates that subjects supported with graphs perform as well as subjects supported with tables, when facing complex symbolic tasks involving decision accuracy. Furthermore, they outperform the latter when facing spatial tasks. Graphs help subjects find solutions faster regardless of task complexity in spatial tasks, while subjects supported with tables are only equally efficient in complex symbolic tasks. Concerning the characteristics of spatial language, Hubona et al. [21] provide support for the cognitive fit theory in terms of decision accuracy but not in terms of time. Recently, Khatri et al.

" Another intra-problem method that is worthy of mention is the intra-problem Adaptive Online Time Allocation (intra-AOTA) approach [8]. As shown by its name, intra-AOTA does not directly select the best algorithm, but iteratively allocates the time budget to a set of candidate algorithms. To be specific, intra-AOTA divides the given time budget into several slots. Each slot corresponds to an iteration. At the first iteration, the time slot is allocated to all the candidate algorithms according to some prior distributions or rules. Then, the average fitness of solutions obtained by each algorithm on the problem is recorded. Then, a linear model that maps the time allocation scheme to expected performance improvements is built and employed to determine the time allocation scheme for the next iteration. This procedure is repeated until the total time budget is used up. In the extreme case, intra-AOTA can also be used for algorithm selection by allocating all the time to a single candidate algorithm at each iteration. AMALGAM [25] and EEAs [16,30] also adopted a similar adaptation strategy as intra-AOTA. ",Positive
