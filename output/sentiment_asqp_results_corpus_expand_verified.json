While such systems have been useful in limited contexts, they have also been criticized as cumbersome: by forcing users to conform to a particular formal system, they constrain communication and make it less natural (Schoop, 2001)",

The study also reported a decrease in sputum cytokines (inflammatory regulators) in the group receiving omega-3 PUFA with no change in the omega-6 PUFA group. The study concluded that “nutritional support with an omega-3 PUFA-rich diet is a safe and practical method for treating COPD” [6].

[1990] reported a .90 “breakeven” result (see Section 7) on a subset of the Reuters test collection, a figure that outperforms even the best classifiers built in the late ’90s by state-of-the-art ML techniques. However, no other classifier has been tested on the same dataset as Construe, and it is not clear whether this was a randomly chosen or a favourable subset of the entire Reuters collection. As argued in [Yang 1999], the results above do not allow us to state that these effectiveness results may be obtained in general.",
