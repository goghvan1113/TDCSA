"al., 1994), compression of sentences with Automatic Translation approaches (Knight and Marcu, 2000), Hidden Markov Model (Jing and McKeown, 2000), Topic Signatures based methods (Lin and Hovy, 2000, Lacatusu et al., 2006) are among the most popular techniques that have been used in the summarization systems of this category.",1
"But in fact, the issue of editing in text summarization has usually been neglected, notable exceptions being the works by Jing and McKeown (2000) and Mani, Gates, and Bloedorn (1999).",1
"The recent approach for editing extracted text spans (Jing and McKeown, 2000) may also produce improvement for our algorithm.",1
"Recent comparisons of approaches that can be trained on corpora (van Halteren et al. , 1998; Volk and Schneider, 1998) have shown that in most cases statistical aproaches (Cutting et al. , 1992; Schmid, 1995; Ratnaparkhi, 1996) yield better results than finite-state, rule-based, or memory-based taggers (Brill, 1993; Daelemans et al. , 1996).",1
"One of the most effective taggers based on a pure HMM is that developed at Xerox (Cutting et al. , 1992).",1
"4.1 Complete ambiguity classes Ambiguity classes capture the relevant property we are interested in: words with the same category possibilities are grouped together.4 And ambiguity classes have been shown to be successfully employed, in a variety of ways, to improve POS tagging (e.g., Cutting et al., 1992; Daelemans et al., 1996; Dickinson, 2007; Goldberg et al., 2008; Tseng et al., 2005).",1
"A number of part-of-speech taggers are readily available and widely used, all trained and retrainable on text corpora (Church 1988; Cutting et al. 1992; Brill 1992; Weischedel et al. 1993).",1
"(Cutting et al. , 1992) reported very high results (96% on the Brown corpus) for unsupervised POS tagging using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) by exploiting hand-built tag dictionaries and equivalence classes.",1
"Stochastic models (Cutting et al. , 1992; Dermatas et al. , 1995; Brants, 2000) have been widely used in POS tagging for simplicity and language independence of the models.",1
"1 Motivation Statistical part-of-speech disambiguation can be efficiently done with n-gram models (Church, 1988; Cutting et al. , 1992).",1
"It has been known for some years that good performance can be realized with partial tagging and a hidden Markov model (Cutting et al. , 1992).",1
"Eigenvector centrality in particular has been successfully applied to many different types of networks, including hyperlinked web pages (Brin and Page, 1998; Kleinberg, 1998), lexical networks (Erkan and Radev, 2004; Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004; Kurland and Lee, 2005; Kurland and Lee, 2006), and semantic networks (Mihalcea et al. , 2004).",1
"First, such a system makes use of lexical information when modeling reordering (Lopez, 2008), which has previously been shown to be useful in German-to-English translation (Koehn et al., 2008).",1
"(Macken et al., 2008) showed that the results for French-English were competitive to state-of-the-art alignment systems.",1
"Then the same system weights are applied to both IncHMM and Joint Decoding -based approaches, and the feature weights of them are trained using the max-BLEU training method proposed by Och (2003) and refined by Moore and Quirk (2008).",1
"1 Introduction Recently linguistically-motivated syntax-based translation method has achieved great success in statistical machine translation (SMT) (Galley et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2006, 2007; Zhang et al., 2007, 2008a; Mi et al., 2008; Mi and Huang 2008; Zhang et al., 2009).",1
"Among these advances, forest-based modeling (Mi et al., 2008; Mi and Huang, 2008) and tree sequence-based modeling (Liu et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2008a) are two interesting modeling methods with promising results reported.",1
"The fluency models hold promise for actual improvements in machine translation output quality (Zwarts and Dras, 2008).",1
"This approach took inspiration from the pioneering work by (Dolan 1994), but it is also fundamentally different, because instead of grouping similar senses together, the CoreLex approach groups together words according to all of their senses.",1
"Lins (1998) information-theoretic similarity measure is commonly used in lexicon acquisition tasks and has demonstrated good performance in unsupervised WSD (McCarthy et al., 2004).",1
"Point-wise mutual information (Lin, 1998) and Relative Feature Focus (Geffet and Dagan, 2004) are well-known examples.",1
"4.1 Features We used a dependency structure as the context for words because it is the most widely used and one of the best performing contextual information in the past studies (Ruge, 1997; Lin, 1998).",1
"Among these measures, the most important are Wu & Palmers (Wu and Palmer, 1994), Resniks (Resnik, 1995) and Lins (Lin, 1998).",1
One of the most important is Lins (1998).,1
Erk (2007) compared a number of techniques for creating similar-word sets and found that both the Jaccard coefficient and Lin (1998a)s information-theoretic metric work best.,1
"This similarity score is computed as a max over a number of component scoring functions, some based on external lexical resources, including:  various string similarity functions, of which most are applied to word lemmas  measures of synonymy, hypernymy, antonymy, and semantic relatedness, including a widelyused measure due to Jiang and Conrath (1997), based on manually constructed lexical resources such as WordNet and NomBank  a function based on the well-known distributional similarity metric of Lin (1998), which automatically infers similarity of words and phrases from their distributions in a very large corpus of English text The ability to leverage external lexical resources both manually and automatically constructedis critical to the success of MANLI.",1
"Whereas dependency based semantic spaces have been shown to surpass other word space models for a number of problems (Pad and Lapata, 2007; Lin, 1998), for the task of categorisation simple pattern based spaces have been shown to perform equally good if not better (Poesio and Almuhareb, 2005b; Almuhareb and Poesio, 2005b).",1
"However, except for (Fraser and Marcu, 2007b), none of these advances in alignment quality has improved translation quality of a state-of-the-art system.",1
"Similar to WSD, Carpuat and Wu (2007a) used contextual information to solve the ambiguity problem for phrases.",1
"Recently, word-sense disambiguation (WSD) methods have been shown to improve translation quality (Chan et al., 2007; Carpuat and Wu, 2007).",1
"In Carpuat and Wu (2007), anotherstate-of-the-artWSDengine(acombination of naive Bayes, maximum entropy, boosting and Kernel PCA models) is used to dynamically determine the score of a phrase pair under consideration and, thus, let the phrase selection adapt to the context of the sentence.",1
"WSD is one of the fundamental problems in natural language processing and is important for applications such as machine translation (MT) (Chan et al., 2007a; Carpuat and Wu, 2007), information retrieval (IR), etc. WSD is typically viewed as a classification problem where each ambiguous word is assigned a sense label (from a pre-defined sense inventory) during the disambiguation process.",1
"There has been considerable skepticism over whether WSD will actually improve performance of applications, but we are now starting to see improvement in performance due to WSD in cross-lingual information retrieval (Clough and Stevenson, 2004; Vossen et al., 2006) and machine translation (Carpuat and Wu, 2007; Chan et al., 2007) and we hope that other applications such as question-answering, text simplication and summarisation might also benet as WSD methods improve.",1
"Promising features might include those over source side reordering rules (Wang et al., 2007) or source context features (Carpuat and Wu, 2007).",1
"On the other hand, integrating an additional component into a baseline SMT system is notoriously tricky as evident in the research on integrating word sense disambiguation (WSD) into SMT systems: different ways of integration lead to conflicting conclusions on whether WSD helps MT performance (Chan et al., 2007; Carpuat and Wu, 2007).",1
"In Statistical Machine Translation (SMT), recent work shows that WSD helps translation quality when the WSD system directly uses translation candidates as sense inventories (Carpuat and Wu, 2007; Chan et al., 2007; Gimenez and M`arquez, 2007).",1
"We are starting to see the beginnings of a positive effect of WSD in NLP applications such as Machine Translation (Carpuat and Wu, 2007; Chan et al., 2007).",1
"Several studies have demonstrated that for instance Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) benefits from incorporating a dedicated WSD module (Chan et al., 2007; Carpuat and Wu, 2007).",1
A solution that leverages the complementary strengths of these two approachesdescribed in detail by McDonald and Nivre (2007)was recently and successfully explored by Nivre and McDonald (2008).,1
"The approach has been shown to give improvements over the MAP classifier in many areas of natural language processing including automatic speech recognition (Goel and Byrne, 2000), machine translation (Kumar and Byrne, 2004; Zhang and Gildea, 2008), bilingual word alignment (Kumar and Byrne, 2002), andparsing(Goodman, 1996; TitovandHenderson, 2006; Smith and Smith, 2007).",1
Smith and Smith (2007) describe a more efficient algorithm that can compute all edge expectations in O(n3) time using the inverse of the Kirchoff matrix K1.,1
"Minimizing risk has been shown to improve performance for MT (Kumar and Byrne, 2004), as well as other language processing tasks (Goodman, 1996; Goel and Byrne, 2000; Kumar and Byrne, 2002; Titov and Henderson, 2006; Smith and Smith, 2007).",1
"Given the parameters{pi0,pi,,K}of the HMM, the joint distribution over hidden states s and observationsy can be written (with s0 = 0): p(s,y|pi0,pi,,K) = Tproductdisplay t=1 p(st|st1)p(yt|st) As Johnson (2007) clearly explained, training the HMM with EM leads to poor results in PoS tagging.",1
"Recent projects in semisupervised (Toutanova and Johnson, 2007) and unsupervised (Biemann et al., 2007; Smith and Eisner, 2005) tagging also show significant progress.",1
"This is also the main reason why most summarization systems applied to news articles do not outperform a simple baseline that just uses the first 100 words of an article (Svore et al., 2007; Nenkova, 2005).",1
"Our similarity method is similar, but simpler, to that used by (Hughes and Ramage, 2007), which report very good results on similarity datasets.",1
"Albeit simple, the algorithm has proven to be very efficient and accurate for the task of parse selection (Collins and Roark, 2004; Collins, 2004; Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005; Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2007).",1
Wikipedia first sentence (WikiFS): Kazama and Torisawa (2007) used Wikipedia as an external knowledge to improve Named Entity Recognition.,1
Kazama and Torisawa (2007) improve their F-score by 3% by including a Wikipedia-based feature in their machine learner.,1
"For instance, Kazama and Torisawa (2007) used the hyponymy relations extracted from Wikipedia for the English NER, and reported improved accuracies with such a gazetteer.",1
"Recently, (Toral and Munoz, 2006; Kazama and Torisawa, 2007a) have successfully constructed high quality and high coverage gazetteers from Wikipedia.",1
"An important aspect of web search is to be able to narrow down search results by distinguishing among people with the same name leading to multiple efforts focusing on web person name disambiguation in the literature (Mann and Yarowsky, 2003; Artiles et al., 2007, Cucerzan, 2007).",1
"Much later work (Evans, 2003; Etzioni et al., 2005; Cucerzan, 2007; Pasca, 2004) relies on the use of extremely large corpora which allow very precise, but sparse features.",1
"We conclude by noting that English language models currently used in speech recognition (Chelba and Jelinek, 1999) and automated language translation (Brants et al., 2007) are much more powerful, employing, for example, 7-gram word models (not letter models) trained on trillions of words.",1
"1 Introduction Very large corpora obtained from the Web have been successfully utilized for many natural languageprocessing(NLP)applications, suchasprepositional phrase (PP) attachment, other-anaphora resolution, spellingcorrection, confusablewordsetdisambiguation and machine translation (Volk, 2001; Modjeska et al., 2003; Lapata and Keller, 2005; Atterer and Schutze, 2006; Brants et al., 2007).",1
"To scale LMs to larger corpora with higher-order dependencies, researchers Work completed while this author was at Google Inc. have considered alternative parameterizations such as class-based models (Brown et al., 1992), model reduction techniques such as entropy-based pruning (Stolcke, 1998), novel represention schemes such as suffix arrays (Emami et al., 2007), Golomb Coding (Church et al., 2007) and distributed language models that scale more readily (Brants et al., 2007).",1
"Here we choose to work with stupid backoff smoothing (Brants et al., 2007) since this is significantly more efficient to train and deploy in a distributed framework than a contextdependent smoothing scheme such as Kneser-Ney.",1
"Indeed, researchers have shown that gigantic language models are key to state-ofthe-art performance (Brants et al., 2007), and the ability of phrase-based decoders to handle large-size, high-order language models with no consequence on asymptotic running time during decoding presents a compelling advantage over CKYdecoders,whosetimecomplexitygrowsprohibitively large with higher-order language models.",1
"Furthermore, the BLEU score performance suggests that our model is not very powerful, but some interesting hints can be found in Table 3 when we compare our method with a 5-gram language model to a state-of-the-art system Moses (Koehn and Hoang, 2007) based on various evaluation metrics, including BLEU score, NIST score (Doddington, 2002), METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005), TER (Snover et al., 2006), WER and PER.",1
"For example, factored translation models (Koehn and Hoang, 2007) retain the simplicity of phrase-based SMT while adding the ability to incorporate additional features.",1
"While this is certainly a daunting task, it is possible that for annotation studies that do not require expert annotators and extensive annotator training, the newly available access to a large pool of inexpensive annotators, such as the Amazon Mechanical Turk scheme (Snow et al., 2008),4 or embedding the task in an online game played by volunteers (Poesio et al., 2008; von Ahn, 2006) could provide some solutions.",1
"1 Introduction State of the art statistical parsers (Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2000; Koo and Collins, 2005; Charniak and Johnson, 2005) are trained on manually annotated treebanks that are highly expensive to create.",1
"In syntactic parse re-ranking supersenses have been used to build useful latent semantic features (Koo and Collins, 2005).",1
"However, the study of Weeds and Weir (2005) provides interesting insights into what makes a good distributional similarity measure in the contexts of semantic similarity prediction and language modeling.",1
"It is explored extensively in (Curran, 2004; Weeds and Weir, 2005).",1
"The best previous result is an accuracy of 56.1% (Turney, 2006).",1
"Veale (2004) used WordNet to answer 374 multiple-choice SAT analogy questions, achieving an accuracy of 43%, but the best corpus-based approach attains an accuracy of 56% (Turney, 2006).",1
"1 Introduction Co-occurrence statistics extracted from corpora lead to good performance on a wide range of tasks that involve the identification of the semantic relation between two words or concepts (Sahlgren, 2006; Turney, 2006).",1
"In the past five years, important research on the automatic acquisition of word classes based on lexical distribution has been published (Church and Hanks, 1990; Hindle, 1990; Smadja, 1993; Grei~nstette, 1994; Grishman and Sterling, 1994).",1
"Church and Hanks (1990) use mutual information to identify collocations, a method they claim is reasonably effective for words with a frequency of not less than five.",1
"Probably the most widely used feature weighting function is (point-wise) Mutual Information (MI) (Church and Patrick 1990; Hindle 1990; Luk 1995; Lin 1998; Gauch, Wang, and Rachakonda 1999; Dagan 2000; Baroni and Vegnaduzzo 2004; Chklovski and Pantel 2004; Pantel and Ravichandran 2004; Pantel, Ravichandran, and Hovy 2004; Weeds, Weir, and McCarthy 2004), dened by: weight MI (w,f)=log 2 P(w,f) P(w)P(f) (1) We calculate the MI weights by the following statistics in the space of co-occurrence instances S: weight MI (w,f)=log 2 count(w,f) nrels count(w) count(f) (2) where count(w,f) is the frequency of the co-occurrence pair w,f  in S, count(w)and count(f) are the independent frequencies of w and f in S,andnrels is the size of S.High MI weights are assumed to correspond to strong wordfeature associations.",1
"The most widely used association weight function is (point-wise) Mutual Information (MI) (Church and Hanks, 1990; Lin, 1998; Dagan, 2000; Weeds et al. , 2004).",1
"Researchers such as (Evans et al. 1991) and (Church and Hanks 1990) have applied robust grammars and statistical techniques over large corpora to extract interesting noun phrases and subject-verb, verb-object pairs.",1
"Arguably the most widely used is the mutual information (Hindle, 1990; Church and Hanks, 1990; Dagan et al. , 1995; Luk, 1995; D. Lin, 1998a).",1
"There are several distance measures suitable for this purpose, such as the mutual information(Church and Hanks, 1990), the dice coefficient(Manning and Schueutze 8.5, 1999), the phi coefficient(Manning and Schuetze 5.3.3, 1999), the cosine measure(Manning and Schueutze 8.5, 1999) and the confidence(Arrawal and Srikant, 1995).",1
"Usually in 1 In our experiments, we set negative PMI values to 0, because Church and Hanks (1990), in their seminal paper on word association ratio, show that negative PMI values are not expected to be accurate unless co-occurrence counts are made from an extremely large corpus.",1
"Unlike Choueka (1988), Church and Hanks (1990) identify as collocations both interrupted and uninterrupted sequences of words.",1
"Similarity-based smoothing (Brown et al. , 1992; Dagan et al. , 1999) is an intuitively appealing approach to this problem where probabilities of unseen co-occurrences are estimated from probabilities of seen co-occurrences of distributionally similar events.",1
"Similarity-based smoothing (Hindle 1990; Brown et al. 1992; Dagan, Marcus, and Markovitch 1993; Pereira, Tishby, and Lee 1993; Dagan, Lee, and Pereira 1999) provides an intuitively appealing approach to language modeling.",1
"The notion of incrementally merging classes of lexical items is intuitively satisfying and is explored in detail in (Brown, et al. 1992).",1
"For example the class-based language model of (Brown et al. , 1992) is defined as: p(w2|w1) = p(w2|c2)p(c2|c1) (1) This helps solve the sparse data problem since the number of classes is usually much smaller than the number of words.",1
"This paper is heavily indebted to prior work on unsupervised learning of position categories such as Brown et al 1992, Schtze 1997, Higgins 2002, and others cited there.",1
"7Another related measure is Dunning (1993)'s likelihood ratio tests for binomial and multinomial distributions, which are claimed to be effective even with very much smaller volumes of text than is necessary for other tests based on assumed normal distributions.",1
"For instance, mutual information (Church ct al. 1990) and the log-likelihood (Dunning 1993) methods for extracting word bigrams have been widely used.",1
"For instance, the mutual information (Church et al. 1990) and log-likelihood ratio (Dunning 1993; Cohen 1995) have been widely used for extracting word bigrams.",1
"(3) () () 0 log 2 log A LH LH     = 1 Problems for an unscaled log  approach Although log  identifies collocations much better than competing approaches (Dunning 1993) in terms of its recall, it suffers from its relatively poor precision rates.",1
"The evaluation results also confirm the argument of Dunning (1993), who suggested G2 as a more robust alternative to X2.",1
"One popular and statistically appealing such measure is Log-Likelihood (LL) (Dunning, 1993).",1
This further supports the claim by Dunning (1993) that loglikelihood ratio is much less sensitive than pmi to low counts.,1
"By default, the log-likelihood ratio measure (LLR) is proposed, since it was shown to be particularly suited to language data (Dunning, 1993).",1
This results also agree with Dunning's argument about overestimation on the infrequent occurrences in which many infrequent pairs tend to get higher estimation (Dunning 1993).,1
"All the enumerated segment pairs are listed in the following table: Feature x,y Feature x,y AM1+1 c1, c0 AM2+1 c2c1, c0 AM1+2 c1, c0c1 AM2+2 c2c1, c0c1 AM1+3 c1, c0c1c2 AM3+1 c3c2c1, c0 We use Dunnings method (Dunning, 1993) because it does not depend on the assumption of normality and it allows comparisons to be made between the signiflcance of the occurrences of both rare and common phenomenon.",1
"In informal experiments described elsewhere (Melamed 1995), I found that the G 2 statistic suggested by Dunning (1993) slightly outperforms 2.",1
"In our experiments, we follow Lowe and McDonald (2000) in using the well-known log-likelihood ratio G 2 (Dunning 1993).",1
"Throughout, the likelihood ratio (Dunning, 1993) is used as significance measure because of its stable performance in various evaluations, yet many more measures are possible.",1
"In order to filter some noise caused by the error alignment links, we only retain those translation pairs whose translation probabilities are above a threshold 1 D 1  or co-occurring frequencies are above a threshold 2  . When we train the IBM statistical word alignment model with a limited bilingual corpus in the specific domain, we build another translation dictionary with the same method as for the dictionary . But we adopt a different filtering strategy for the translation dictionary . We use log-likelihood ratio to estimate the association strength of each translation pair because Dunning (1993) proved that log-likelihood ratio performed very well on small-scale data.",1
"Moreover, log likelihood ratios are regarded as a more effective method to identify collocations especially when the occurrence count is very low (Dunning, 1993).",1
"We preferred the log-likelihood ratio to other statistical scores, such as the association ratio (Church and Hanks, 1990) or ;(2, since it adequately takes into account the frequency of the co-occurring words and is less sensitive to rare events and corpussize (Dunning, 1993; Daille, 1996).",1
"They were based on mutual information (Church & Hanks, 1989), conditional probabilities (Rapp, 1996), or on some standard statistical tests, such as the chi-square test or the loglikelihood ratio (Dunning, 1993).",1
"2.2.2 The Binomial Log Likelihood Ratio as a Statistical Filter Dunning (1993) demonstrates the benefits of the LLR statistic, compared to Pearson's chisquared, on the task of ranking bigram data.",1
"a list of pilot terms ranked from the most representative of the corpus to the least thanks to the Loglikelihood coefficient introduced by (Dunning, 1993).",1
"For the current work, the Log-likelihood coefficient has been employed (Dunning, 1993), as it is reported to perform well among other scoring methods (Daille, 1995).",1
"Pr(cJ1,aJ1|eI1) = p(J|I)(I + 1)J Jproductdisplay j=1 p(cj|eaj) (8) 3.1.2 Log-likelihood ratio The log-likelihood ratio statistic has been found to be accurate for modeling the associations between rare events (Dunning, 1993).",1
"Many previous studies have shown that the log-likelihood ratio is well suited for this purpose (Dunning, 1993).",1
"It can be expected that the log-likelihood ratio produces an accurate ranking of word pairs that highly correlates with human judgment (Dunning, 1993), although there are other measures which come close in performance (e.g. Rapp, 1998).",1
"(Dunning, 1993) and (Pedersen, 1996) shows how some of the methods which have been used in the past (particularly mutual information scores) are invalid for rare events, and introduce accurate measures of how 'surprising' rare events are.",1
"Tools like Xtract (Smadja 1993) were based on the work of Church and others, but made a step forward by incorporating various statistical measurements like z-score and variance of distribution, as well as shallow linguistic techniques like part-of-speech tagging and lemmatization of input data and partial parsing of raw output.",1
"Smadja (1993), which is the classic work on collocation extraction, uses a two-stage filtering model in which, in the first step, n-gram statistics determine possible collocations and, in the second step, these candidates are submitted to a syntactic valida7Of course, lexical material is always at least partially dependent on the domain in question.",1
"In the past five years, important research on the automatic acquisition of word classes based on lexical distribution has been published (Church and Hanks, 1990; Hindle, 1990; Smadja, 1993; Grei~nstette, 1994; Grishman and Sterling, 1994).",1
"One of the best efforts to quantify the performance of a term-recognition system (Smadja, 1993) does so only for one processing stage, leaving unassessed the text-to-output performance of the system.",1
"For the extraction problem, there have been various methods proposed to date, which are quite adequate (Hindle and Rooth 1991; Grishman and Sterling 1992; Manning 1992; Utsuro, Matsumoto, and Nagao 1992; Brent 1993; Smadja 1993; Grefenstette 1994; Briscoe and Carroll 1997).",1
"Many efficient techniques exist to extract multiword expressions, collocations, lexical units and idioms (Church and Hanks, 1989; Smadja, 1993; Dias et al. , 2000; Dias, 2003).",1
"Study in collocation extraction using lexical statistics has gained some insights to the issues faced in collocation extraction (Church and Hanks 1990, Smadja 1993, Choueka 1993, Lin 1998).",1
"In statistical machine translation, IBM 1~5 models (Brown et al. , 1993) based on the source-chmmel model have been widely used and revised for many language donmins and applications.",1
"Another kind of popular approaches to dealing with query translation based on corpus-based techniques uses a parallel corpus containing aligned sentences whose translation pairs are corresponding to each other (Brown et al. , 1993; Dagan et al. , 1993; Smadja et al. , 1996).",1

"In their seminal paper on SMT, Brownand his colleagues highlighted the problems weface aswe go from IBM Models 1-2 to 3-5(Brown et al. , 1993) 3: Asweprogress from Model1toModel5, evaluating the expectations that gives us counts becomes increasingly difficult.",1
The implementation of MEBA was strongly influenced by the notorious five IBM models described in (Brown et al. 1993).,1
"While EM has worked quite well for a few tasks, notably machine translations (starting with the IBM models 1-5 (Brown et al., 1993), it has not had success in most others, such as part-of-speech tagging (Merialdo, 1991), named-entity recognition (Collins and Singer, 1999) and context-free-grammar induction (numerous attempts, too many to mention).",1
"The IBM models 1-5 (Brown et al. , 1993) produce word alignments with increasing algorithmic complexity and performance.",1
"The IBM models have shown good performance in machine translation, and especially so within certain families of languages, for example in translating between French and English or between Sinhalese and Tamil (Brown et al. , 1993; Weerasinghe, 2004).",1
"This is a common technique in machine translation for which the IBM translation models are popular methods (Brown et al. , 1993).",1
One widely used model is the IBM model (Brown et al. 1993).,1
"It was initially proposed by (Brown et al. , 1993) and, more recently, have been intensively studied by several research groups (Germann et al. , 2001; Och et al. , 2003).",1
"Yet the modeling, training, and search methods have also improved since the field of statistical machine translation was pioneered by IBM in the late 1980s and early 1990s (Brown et al. 1990; Brown et al. 1993; Berger et al. 1994).",1
"According to our experience, the best performance is achieved when the union of the source-to-target and target-to-source alignment sets (IBM models; Brown et al. [1993]) is used for tuple extraction (some experimental results regarding this issue are presented in Section 4.2.2).",1
Introduction Automatic word alignment (Brown et al. 1993) is a vital component of all statistical machine translation (SMT) approaches.,1
"1 Introduction As with many other statistical natural language processing tasks, statistical machine translation (Brown et al. , 1993) produces high quality results when ample training data is available.",1
"For the IBM models defined by a pioneering paper (Brown et al. , 1993), a decoding algorithm based on a left-to-right search was described in (Berger et al. , 1996).",1
"Being inspired by the success of noisy-channel-based approaches in applications as diverse as speech recognition (Jelinek, 1997), part of speech tagging (Church, 1988), machine translation (Brown et al. , 1993), information retrieval (Berger and Lafferty, 1999), and text summarization (Knight and Marcu, 2002), we develop a noisy channel model for QA.",1
"The former term P(E) is called a language model, representing the likelihood of E. The latter term P(J|E) is called a translation model, representing the generation probability from E into J. As an implementation of P(J|E), the word alignment based statistical translation (Brown et al. , 1993) has been successfully applied to similar language pairs, such as FrenchEnglish and German English, but not to drastically dierent ones, such as JapaneseEnglish.",1

"1 Introduction IBM Model 1 (Brown et al. , 1993a) is a wordalignment model that is widely used in working with parallel bilingual corpora.",1
"Bootstrapping a PMTG from a lower-dimensional PMTG and a word-to-word translation model is similar in spirit to the way that regular grammars can help to estimate CFGs (Lari & Young, 1990), and the way that simple translation models can help to bootstrap more sophisticated ones (Brown et al. , 1993).",1
"Syntax-light alignment models such as the five IBM models (Brown et al. , 1993) and their relatives have proved to be very successful and robust at producing word-level alignments, especially for closely related languages with similar word order and mostly local reorderings, which can be captured via simple models of relative word distortion.",1
"1 Introduction Statistical approaches to machine translation, pioneered by (Brown et al. , 1993), achieved impressive performance by leveraging large amounts of parallel corpora.",1
"There are basically two kinds of systems working at these segmentation levels: the most widespread rely on statistical models, in particular the IBM ones (Brown et al. , 1993); others combine simpler association measures with different kinds of linguistic information (Arhenberg et al. , 2000; Barbu, 2004).",1
"In this paper, we show that a noisy channel model instantiated within the paradigm of Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) (Brown et al. , 1993) can successfully provide editorial assistance for non-native writers.",1
"1 Introduction The most widely applied training procedure for statistical machine translation IBM model 4 (Brown et al. , 1993) unsupervised training followed by post-processing with symmetrization heuristics (Och and Ney, 2003) yields low quality word alignments.",1
"Aligning tokens in parallel sentences using the IBM Models (Brown et al. , 1993), (Och and Ney, 2003) may require less information than full-blown translation since the task is constrained by the source and target tokens present in each sentence pair.",1
"Such methods have also been a key driver of progress in statistical machine translation, which depends heavily on unsupervised word alignments (Brown et al. , 1993).",1
"For the word alignment, we apply standard techniques derived from statistical machine translation using the well-known IBM alignment models (Brown et al. , 1993) implemented in the opensource tool GIZA++ (Och, 2003).",1
"Finally, the translation model can be formalized as the following optimization problem argmax logPr(D;) s.t. mwsummationdisplay j=1 Pr(wj|ok) = 1,k This optimization problem can be solved by the EM algorithm (Brown et al. , 1993).",1
"This is an important feature from the MT viewpoint, since the decomposition into translation model and language model proved to be extremely useful in statistical MT since (Brown et al., 1993).",1
"Widely used alignment models, such as IBM Model serial (Brown et al., 1993) and HMM , all assume one-to-many alignments.",1
"Corpus-based or example-based MT (Sato and Nagao, 1990; Sumita and Iida, 1991) and statistical MT (Brown et al. , 1993) systems provide the easiest customizability, since users have only to supply a collection of source and target sentence pairs (a bilingual corpus).",1
"1 Introduction Over the past decade, researchers at IBM have developed a series of increasingly sophisticated statistical models for machine translation (Brown et al. , 1988; Brown et al. , 1990; Brown et al. , 1993a).",1
"(Brown et al. , 1993) then extended their method and established a sound probabilistic model series, relying on different parameters describing how words within parallel sentences are aligned to each other.",1
"In previous work (Foster, 2000), I described a Maximum Entropy/Minimum Divergence (MEMD) model (Berger et al. , 1996) for p(w\[hi, s) which incorporates a trigram language model and a translation component which is an analog of the well-known IBM translation model 1 (Brown et al. , 1993).",1
"3 Experimental Results Whereas stochastic modelling is widely used in speech recognition, there are so far only a few research groups that apply stochastic modelling to language translation (Berger et al. 1994; Brown et al. 1993; Knight 1999).",1
"2.2 Statistical Translation Lexicon We use a statistical translation lexicon known as IBM Model-1 in (Brown et al. , 1993) for both efficiency and simplicity.",1

"The IBM source-channel model for statistical machine translation (P. Brown et al. , 1993) plays a central role in our system.",1
"When efficient techniques have been proposed (Brown et al. , 1993; Och and Ney, 2003), they have been mostly evaluated on safe pairs of languages where the notion of word is rather clear.",1
"1 Introduction The most widely used alignment model is IBM Model 4 (Brown et al. , 1993).",1
"Turning off the extensions to GIZA++ and training p0 as in (Brown et al. , 1993) produces a substantial increase in AER.",1
"A quite different approach from our hypotheses testing implemented in the TREQ-AL aligner is taken by the model-estimating aligners, most of them relying on the IBM models (1 to 5) described in the (Brown et al. 1993) seminal paper.",1
"State-of-art systems for doing word alignment use generative models like GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003; Brown et al. , 1993).",1
"1 Introduction The availability of large amounts of so-called parallel texts has motivated the application of statistical techniques to the problem of machine translation starting with the seminal work at IBM in the early 90s (Brown et al. , 1992; Brown et al. , 1993).",1
"Specifically, in the task of word alignment, heuristic approaches such as the Dice coefficient consistently underperform their re-estimated counterparts, such as the IBM word alignment models (Brown et al. , 1993).",1
"Statistical models for machine translation heavily depend on the concept of alignment, specifically, the well known IBM word based models (Brown et al. , 1993).",1
"The most widely used single-word-based statistical alignment models (SAMs) have been proposed in (Brown et al. , 1993; Ney et al. , 2000).",1
"In the well-known so-called IBM word alignment models (Brown et al., 1993), re-estimating the model parameters depends on the empirical probability P(ek,fk) for each sentence pair (ek,fk).",1
"Generative word alignment models, initially developed at IBM (Brown et al., 1993), and then augmented by an HMM-based model (Vogel et al., 1996), have provided powerful modeling capability for word alignment.",1
Brute-force methods (ie those that exploit the massive raw computing power currently available cheaply) may well produce some useful results (eg Brown et al 1993).,1
"Preparing tagged corpora either by hand is labour-intensive and potentially error-prone, and although a semi-automatic approach can be used (Marcus et al. , 1993), it is a good thing to reduce the human involvement as much as possible.",1
"1 Introduction Syntactically annotated corpora like the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al. , 1993), the NeGra corpus (Skut et al. , 1998) or the statistically dismnbiguated parses in (Bell et al. , 1999) provide a wealth of intbrmation, which can only be exploited with an adequate query language.",1
"To some extent, this can probably be explained by the strong tradition of constituent analysis in Anglo-American linguistics, but this trend has been reinforced by the fact that the major treebank of American English, the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al. , 1993), is annotated primarily with constituent analysis.",1
"Recently, we can see an important development in natural language processing and computational linguistics towards the use of empirical learning methods (for instance, (Charniak, 1993; Marcus et al. , 1993; Wermter, 11995; Jones, 1995; Werml;er et al. , 1996)).",1
"Successflfl examples of reuse of data resources include: the WordNet thesaurus (Miller el; al. , 1993); the Penn Tree Bank (Marcus et al. , 1993); the Longmans Dictionary of Contemporary English (Summers, 1995).",1
"In the statistical NLP community, the most widely used grammatical resource is the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993).",1
"Particularly, syntactically annotated corpora (treebanks), such as Penn Treebank (Marcus et al. , 1993), Negra Corpus (Skut et al. , 1997) and EDR Corpus (Jap, 1994), contribute to improve the performance of morpho-syntactic analysis systems.",1
"This kind of corpus has served as an extremely valuable resource for computational linguistics applications such as machine translation and question answering (Lee et al. , 1997; Choi, 2001), and has also proved useful in theoretical linguistics research (Marcus et al. , 1993).",1
"Some notable efforts in this direction for other languages have been the Penn Tree Bank (Marcus et al., 1993) for English and the Prague Dependency Bank (Hajicova, 1998) for Czech.",1
"One of the largest and earliest such efforts is the Penn Treebank (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz 1993; Marcus et al. 1994), which contains a one-million word  Institute for Research in Cognitive Science, University of Pennsylvania, 3401 Walnut Street, Suite 400A, Philadelphia, PA 19104-6228, USA.",1
"1 Introduction By exploiting information encoded in human-produced syntactic trees (Marcus et al. , 1993), research on probabilistic models of syntax has driven the performance of syntactic parsers to about 90% accuracy (Charniak, 2000; Collins, 2000).",1
"2 Treebanking The Penn Treebank (Marcus et al. , 1993) is annotated with information to make predicate-argument structure easy to decode, including function tags and markers of empty categories that represent displaced constituents.",1
The default training set of Penn Treebank (Marcus et al. 1993) was used for the parser because the domain and style of those texts actually matches fairly well with the domain and style of the texts on which a reading level predictor for second language learners might be used.,1
"However, evaluations on the widely used WSJ corpus of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al. , 1993) show that the accuracy of these parsers still lags behind the state-of-theart.",1
"1 Introduction Robust statistical syntactic parsers, made possible by new statistical techniques (Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2000; Bikel, 2004) and by the availability of large, hand-annotated training corpora such as WSJ (Marcus et al. , 1993) and Switchboard (Godefrey et al. , 1992), have had a major impact on the field of natural language processing.",1

"1 Introduction Research in language processing has benefited greatly from the collection of large annotated corpora such as Penn PropBank (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002) and Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993).",1
"One major resource for corpus-based research is the treebanks available in many research organizations \[Marcus et al.1993\], which carry skeletal syntactic structures or 'brackets' that have been manually verified.",1
"Penn Treebank(Marcus et al. , 1993) was also used to induce part-of-speech (POS) taggers because the corpus contains very precise and detailed POS markers as well as bracket, annotations.",1
Introduction The Penn Treebank (Marcus et al. 1993) initiated a new paradigm in corpus-based research.,1
"The creation of the Penn English Treebank (Marcus et al. , 1993), a syntactically interpreted corpus, played a crucial role in the advances in natural language parsing technology (Collins, 1997; Collins, 2000; Charniak, 2000) for English.",1

"On the other hand, high-quality treebanks such as the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al. , 1993) and the Kyoto University text corpus (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1997) have contributed to improving the accuracies of fundamental techniques for natural language processing such as morphological analysis and syntactic structure analysis.",1
"The Penn TreeBank (PTB) is an example of such a resource with worldwide impact on natural language processing (Marcus et al. , 1993).",1
"Introduction The creation of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al, 1993) and the word sense-annotated SEMCOR (Fellbaum, 1997) have shown how even limited amounts of annotated data can result in major improvements in complex natural language understanding systems.",1
"1 Introduction There is a pressing need for a consensus on a taskoriented level of semantic representation that can enable the development of powerful new semantic analyzers in the same way that the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al. , 1993) enabled the development of statistical syntactic parsers (Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2001).",1
"We evaluated the generator on the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al. , 1993), which is highly reliable corpus consisting of real-world texts.",1
"After the success in syntactic (Penn TreeBank (Marcus et al. , 1993)) and propositional encodings (Penn PropBank (Palmer et al. , 2005)), more sophisticated semantic data (such as temporal (Pustejovsky et al. , 2003) or opinion annotations (Wiebe et al. , 2005)) and discourse data (e.g. , for anaphora resolution (van Deemter and Kibble, 2000) and rhetorical parsing (Carlson et al. , 2003)) are being generated.",1
"While significant time savings have already been reported on the basis of automatic pre-tagging (e.g. , for POS and parse tree taggings in the Penn TreeBank (Marcus et al. , 1993), or named entity taggings for the Genia corpus (Ohta et al. , 2002)), this kind of pre-processing does not reduce the number of text tokens actually to be considered.",1

"The Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) has until recently been the only such corpus, covering 4.5M words in a single genre of financial reporting.",1
"Many mainstream systems and formalisms would satisfy these criteria, including ones such as the University of Pennsylvania Treebank (Marcus et al, 1993) which are purely syntactic (though of course, only syntactic properties could then be extracted).",1
"Our training and test corpora, for instance, are lessthan-gargantuan compared to such collections as the Penn Treebank \[Marcus et al. , 1993\].",1

"1 Introduction Phrase-based method (Koehn et al., 2003; Och and Ney, 2004; Koehn et al., 2007) and syntaxbased method (Wu, 1997; Yamada and Knight, 2001; Eisner, 2003; Chiang, 2005; Cowan et al., 2006; Marcu et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2007c, 2008a, 2008b; Shen et al., 2008; Mi and Huang, 2008) represent the state-of-the-art technologies in statistical machine translation (SMT).",1

"Wu (1995, 1997) investigated the use of concurrent parsing of parallel corpora in a transduction inversion framework, helping to resolve attachment ambiguities in one language by the coupled parsing state in the second language.",1
"Some methods which can offer powerful reordering policies have been proposed like syntax based machine translation (Yamada and Knight, 2001) and Inversion Transduction Grammar (Wu, 1997).",1
Wu (1997) showed that restricting word-level alignments between sentence pairs to observe syntactic bracketing constraints significantly reduces the complexity of the alignment problem and allows a polynomial-time solution.,1
"In the hierarchical phrase-based model (Chiang, 2005), and an inversion transduction grammar (ITG) (Wu, 1997), the problem is resolved by restricting to a binarized form where at most two non-terminals are allowed in the righthand side.",1
"Wu (1997) has been unable to find real examples of cases where hierarchical alignment would fail under these conditions, at least in fixed-word-order languages that are lightly inflected, such as English and Chinese. (p. 385).",1
"The Inversion Transduction Grammar or ITG formalism, described in (Wu, 1997), is well suited for our purposes.",1
"Fortunately, Wu (1997) provides a method to have an ITG respect a known partial structure.",1
"1 Introduction For statistical machine translation (SMT), phrasebased methods (Koehn et al. , 2003; Och and Ney, 2004) and syntax-based methods (Wu, 1997; Alshawi et al. 2000; Yamada and Knignt, 2001; Melamed, 2004; Chiang, 2005; Quick et al. , 2005; Mellebeek et al. , 2006) outperform word-based methods (Brown et al. , 1993).",1
"Recently, many syntax-based models have been proposed to address the above deficiencies (Wu, 1997; Chiang, 2005; Eisner, 2003; Ding and Palmer, 2005; Quirk et al, 2005; Cowan et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2007; Bod, 2007; Yamada and Knight, 2001; Liu et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2007; Gildea, 2003; Poutsma, 2000; Hearne and Way, 2003).",1
"1 Introduction In recent years, Bracketing Transduction Grammar (BTG) proposed by (Wu, 1997) has been widely used in statistical machine translation (SMT).",1
"Research in this direction was pioneered by (Wu, 1997), who developed Inversion Transduction Grammars to capture crosslingual grammar variations such as phrase reorderings.",1
"This source of overcounting is considered and fixed by Wu (1997) and Zens and Ney (2003), which we briefly review here.",1
"Several studies have reported alignment or translation performance for syntactically augmented translation models (Wu, 1997; Wang, 1998; Alshawi et al. , 2000; Yamada and Knight, 2001; Jones and Havrilla, 1998) and these results have been promising.",1
"More suitable ways could be bilingual chunk parsing, and refining the bracketing grammar as described in [Wu 1997].",1
"Whereas language generation has benefited from syntax [Wu, 1997; Alshawi et al. , 2000], the performance of statistical phrase-based machine translation when relying solely on syntactic phrases has been reported to be poor [Koehn et al. , 2003].",1
"Moreover, for reasons discussed by Wu (1997), ITGs possess an interesting intrinsic combinatorial property of permitting roughly up to four arguments of any frame to be transposed freely, but not more.",1
"An efficient Viterbi-like parsing algorithm that is based on a Dynamic Programing Scheme is proposed in (Wu, 1997).",1
"The efficient block alignment algorithm in Section 4 is related to the inversion transduction grammar approach to bilingual parsing described in (Wu, 1997): in both cases the number of alignments is drastically reduced by introducing appropriate re-ordering restrictions.",1
"Inversion transduction grammar (Wu, 1997), or ITG, is a wellstudied synchronous grammar formalism.",1
"Synchronous parsing models have been explored with moderate success (Wu, 1997; Quirk et al. , 2005).",1
"However, the only known work which automates part of a customer service center using natural language dialogue is the one by Chu-Carroll and Carpenter (1999).",1
"g2 2 Motivation The success of Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) has sparked a successful line of investigation that treats paraphrase acquisition and generation essentially as a monolingual machine translation problem (e.g. , Barzilay & Lee, 2003; Pang et al. , 2003; Quirk et al. , 2004; Finch et al. , 2004).",1
"Such a method alleviates the problem of creating templates from examples which would be used in an ulterior phase of generation (BARZILAY and LEE, 2003).",1
"1 Introduction State-of-the-art Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) systems usually adopt a two-pass search strategy (Och, 2003; Koehn, et al., 2003) as shown in Figure 1.",1
"1 Introduction The emergence of phrase-based statistical machine translation (PSMT) (Koehn et al., 2003) has been one of the major developments in statistical approaches to translation.",1
"For French/English translation we use a state of the art phrase-based MT system similar to (Och and Ney, 2004; Koehn et al. , 2003).",1
"1 Introduction The recent advances in statistical machine translation have been achieved by discriminatively training a small number of real-valued features based either on (hierarchical) phrase-based translation (Och and Ney, 2004; Koehn et al. , 2003; Chiang, 2005) or syntax-based translation (Galley et al. , 2006).",1
"486 One of the most popular instantiations of loglinear models is that including phrase-based (PB) models (Zens et al., 2002; Koehn et al., 2003).",1
"Beam-search has been successful in many NLP tasks (Koehn et al., 2003; 562 Inputs: training examples (xi,yi) Initialization: set vectorw = 0 Algorithm: // R training iterations; N examples for t = 1R, i = 1N: zi = argmaxyGEN(xi) (y) vectorw if zi negationslash= yi: vectorw = vectorw + (yi)(zi) Outputs: vectorw Figure 1: The perceptron learning algorithm Collins and Roark, 2004), and can achieve accuracy that is close to exact inference.",1
"1 Introduction Many state-of-the-art machine translation (MT) systems over the past few years (Och and Ney, 2002; Koehn et al., 2003; Chiang, 2007; Koehn et al., 2007; Li et al., 2009) rely on several models to evaluate the goodness of a given candidate translation in the target language.",1
"1 Introduction We have seen rapid recent progress in machine translation through the use of rich features and the development of improved decoding algorithms, often based on grammatical formalisms.1 If we view MT as a machine learning problem, features and formalisms imply structural independence assumptions, which are in turn exploited by efficient inference algorithms, including decoders (Koehn et al., 2003; Yamada and Knight, 2001).",1
"1 Introduction Phrase-based method (Koehn et al., 2003; Och and Ney, 2004; Koehn et al., 2007) and syntaxbased method (Wu, 1997; Yamada and Knight, 2001; Eisner, 2003; Chiang, 2005; Cowan et al., 2006; Marcu et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2007c, 2008a, 2008b; Shen et al., 2008; Mi and Huang, 2008) represent the state-of-the-art technologies in statistical machine translation (SMT).",1
"Besides relative frequencies, lexical weights (Koehn et al., 2003) are widely used to estimate how well the words in f translate the words in e. To do this, one needs first to estimate a lexical translation probability distribution w(e|f) by relative frequency from the same word alignments in the training corpus: w(e|f) = count(f,e)summationtext e count(f,e) (3) Note that a special source NULL token is added to each source sentence and aligned to each unaligned target word.",1
"1 Introduction Todays statistical machine translation systems rely on high quality phrase translation pairs to acquire state-of-the-art performance, see (Koehn et al. , 2003; Zens and Ney, 2004; Och and Ney, 2003).",1
"For our experiments, we chose GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2000) and the RA approach (Koehn et al. , 2003) the best known alignment combination technique as our initial aligners.1 4.2 TBL Templates Our templates consider consecutive words (of size 1, 2 or 3) in both languages.",1
"Nowadays, most of the state-of-the-art SMT systems are based on bilingual phrases (Bertoldi et al. , 2004; Koehn et al. , 2003; Och and Ney, 2004; Tillmann, 2003; Vogel et al. , 2004; Zens and Ney, 2004).",1
"Although bi-alignments are known to exhibit high precision (Koehn et al., 2003), in the face of sparse annotations we use unidirectional alignments as a fallback, as has been proposed in the context of phrase-based machine translation (Koehn et al., 2003; Tillmann, 2003).",1
"Phrases extracted using these heuristics are also shown to perform better than syntactically motivated phrases, the joint model, and IBM model 4 (Koehn et al., 2003).",1
"Nowadays, most state-of-the-art SMT systems are based on bilingual phrases (Och, Tillmann, and Ney 1999; Koehn, Och, and Marcu 2003; Tillmann 2003; Bertoldi et al. 2004; Vogel et al. 2004; Zens and Ney 2004; Chiang 2005).",1
"Along this line, (Koehn et al. , 2003) present convincing evidence that restricting phrasal translation to syntactic constituents yields poor translation performance  the ability to translate nonconstituent phrases (such as there are, note that, and according to) turns out to be critical and pervasive.",1
"1 Introduction In recent years, phrase-based systems for statistical machine translation (Och et al. , 1999; Koehn et al. , 2003; Venugopal et al. , 2003) have delivered state-of-the-art performance on standard translation tasks.",1
"2 The Problem of Coverage in SMT Statistical machine translation made considerable advances in translation quality with the introduction of phrase-based translation (Marcu and Wong, 2002; Koehn et al. , 2003; Och and Ney, 2004).",1
"We view this as a particularly promising aspect of our work, given that phrase-based systems such as Pharaoh (Koehn et al. , 2003) perform better with higher recall alignments.",1
"Most stateof-the-art SMT systems treat grammatical elements in exactly the same way as content words, and rely on general-purpose phrasal translations and target language models to generate these elements (e.g. , Och and Ney, 2002; Koehn et al. , 2003; Quirk et al. , 2005; Chiang, 2005; Galley et al. , 2006).",1
"They provide pairs of phrases that are used to construct a large set of potential translations for each input sentence, along with feature values associated with each phrase pair that are used to select the best translation from this set.1 The most widely used method for building phrase translation tables (Koehn et al. , 2003) selects, from a word alignment of a parallel bilingual training corpus, all pairs of phrases (up to a given length) that are consistent with the alignment.",1
"We compared a baseline system, the state-of-the-art phrase-based system Pharaoh (Koehn et al. , 2003; Koehn, 2004a), against our system.",1
"Results using the method show an improvement from 25.2% Bleu score to 26.8% Bleu score (a statistically significant improvement), using a phrase-based system (Koehn et al. , 2003) which has been shown in the past to be a highly competitive SMT system.",1
"More recently, phrase-based models (Och et al. , 1999; Marcu and Wong, 2002; Koehn et al. , 2003) have been proposed as a highly successful alternative to the IBM models.",1
"Recently, various works have improved the quality of statistical machine translation systems by using phrase translation (Koehn et al. , 2003; Marcu et al. , 2002; Och et al. , 1999; Och and Ney, 2000; Zens et al. , 2004).",1
"1 Introduction Phrase-based translation models (Marcu and Wong, 2002; Koehn et al. , 2003; Och and Ney, 2004), which go beyond the original IBM translation models (Brown et al. , 1993) 1 by modeling translations of phrases rather than individual words, have been suggested to be the state-of-theart in statistical machine translation by empirical evaluations.",1
"4 Experiments Phrase-based SMT systems have been shown to outperform word-based approaches (Koehn et al. , 2003).",1
"To perform translation, state-of-the-art MT systems use a statistical phrase-based approach (Marcu and Wong, 2002; Koehn et al. , 2003; Och and Ney, 2004) by treating phrases as the basic units of translation.",1
"Recently, Cabezas and Resnik (2005) experimented with incorporating WSD translations into Pharaoh, a state-of-the-art phrase-based MT system (Koehn et al. , 2003).",1
"1 Introduction Statistical machine translation (Brown et al. , 1993) has seen many improvements in recent years, most notably the transition from wordto phrase-based models (Koehn et al. , 2003).",1
1 Motivation Phrase-based statistical machine translation (Koehn et al. 2003) has emerged as the dominant paradigm in machine translation research.,1
"Phrase-based decoding (Koehn et al., 2003) is a dominant formalism in statistical machine translation.",1
"The most widely used approach derives phrase pairs from word alignment matrix (Och and Ney, 2003; Koehn et al., 2003).",1
"However, since most of statistical translation models (Koehn et al., 2003; Chiang, 2007; Galley et al., 2006) are symmetrical, it is relatively easy to train a translation system to translate from English to Chinese, except that weneed to train aChinese language model from the Chinese monolingual data.",1
"1 Introduction Phrase-based modeling method (Koehn et al., 2003; Och and Ney, 2004a) is a simple, but powerful mechanism to machine translation since it can model local reorderings and translations of multiword expressions well.",1
"1 Introduction Phrase-based systems (Koehn et al., 2003) are probably the most widespread class of Statistical Machine Translation systems, and arguably one of the most successful.",1
"1 Introduction Hierarchical approaches to machine translation have proven increasingly successful in recent years (Chiang, 2005; Marcu et al., 2006; Shen et al., 2008), and often outperform phrase-based systems (Och and Ney, 2004; Koehn et al., 2003) on target-language fluency and adequacy.",1
"1 Introduction The field of machine translation has seen many advances in recent years, most notably the shift from word-based (Brown et al., 1993) to phrasebased models which use token n-grams as translation units (Koehn et al., 2003).",1
"1 Introduction In recent years, various phrase translation approaches (Marcu and Wong, 2002; Och et al. , 1999; Koehn et al. , 2003) have been shown to outperform word-to-word translation models (Brown et al. , 1993).",1
"1 Introduction During the last four years, various implementations and extentions to phrase-based statistical models (Marcu and Wong, 2002; Koehn et al. , 2003; Och and Ney, 2004) have led to significant increases in machine translation accuracy.",1
"1 Introduction During the last few years, SMT systems have evolved from the original word-based approach (Brown et al. , 1993) to phrase-based translation systems (Koehn et al. , 2003).",1
"The current state of the art is represented by the so-called phrase-based translation approach (Och and Ney, 2004; Koehn et al. , 2003).",1
"This translation model differs from the well known phrase-based translation approach (Koehn et al. , 2003) in two basic issues: rst, training data is monotonously segmented into bilingual units; and second, the model considers n-gram probabilities instead of relative frequencies.",1
"However, attempts to retrofit syntactic information into the phrase-based paradigm have not met with enormous success (Koehn et al. , 2003; Och et al. , 2003)1, and purely phrase-based machine translation systems continue to outperform these syntax/phrase-based hybrids.",1
"1 Introduction Recent works in statistical machine translation (SMT) shows how phrase-based modeling (Och and Ney, 2000a; Koehn et al. , 2003) significantly outperform the historical word-based modeling (Brown et al. , 1993).",1
"And again, we see this insight informing statistical machine translation systems, for instance, in the phrase-based approaches of Och (2003) and Koehn et al.",1
"1 Introduction Modern phrasal SMT systems such as (Koehn et al. , 2003) derive much of their power from being able to memorize and use long phrases.",1
"Phrase-based MT systems are straightforward to train from parallel corpora (Koehn et al., 2003) and, like the original IBM models (Brown et al., 1990), benefit from standard language models built on large monolingual, target-language corpora (Brants et al., 2007).",1

"We conclude with some challenges that still remain in applying proactive learning for MT. 2 Syntax Based Machine Translation In recent years, corpus based approaches to machine translation have become predominant, with Phrase Based Statistical Machine Translation (PBSMT) (Koehn et al., 2003) being the most actively progressing area.",1
"1 Introduction Phrase-based statistical machine translation models (Marcu and Wong, 2002; Koehn et al., 2003; Och and Ney, 2004; Koehn, 2004; Koehn et al., 2007) have achieved significant improvements in translation accuracy over the original IBM word-based model.",1

"5.2 Results We use a Maximum Entropy (ME) classi er (Manning and Klein, 2003) which allows an e cient combination of many overlapping features.",1
"1 Introduction Recently linguistically-motivated syntax-based translation method has achieved great success in statistical machine translation (SMT) (Galley et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2006, 2007; Zhang et al., 2007, 2008a; Mi et al., 2008; Mi and Huang 2008; Zhang et al., 2009).",1
"This algorithm is referred to as GHKM (Galley et al., 2004) and is widely used in SSMT systems (Galley et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2006).",1
"However, to be more expressive and flexible, it is often easier to start with a general SCFG or tree-transducer (Galley et al. , 2004).",1
"Experiments show that the resulting rule set significantly improves the speed and accuracy over monolingual binarization (see Table 1) in a stateof-the-art syntax-based machine translation system (Galley et al. , 2004).",1
"Extensive research concerning the integration of semantic knowledge into NLP for the English language has been arguably fostered by the emergence of WordNet::Similarity package (Pedersen et al. , 2004).1 In its turn, the development of the WordNet based semantic similarity software has been facilitated by the availability of tools to easily retrieve 1http://www.d.umn.edu/a0 tpederse/similarity.html data from WordNet, e.g. WordNet::QueryData,2 jwnl.3 Research integrating semantic knowledge into NLP for languages other than English is scarce.",1
"We believe that the extensive usage of such measures derives also from the availability of robust and freely availablesoftwarethatallowstocomputethem(Pedersen et al. , 2004, WordNet::Similarity).",1
"The WordNet::Similarity package provides a flexible implementation of many of these measures (Pedersen et al., 2004).",1
"Also, slightly restating the advantages of phrase-pairs identified in (Quirk and Menezes, 2006), these blocks are effective at capturing context including the encoding of non-compositional phrase pairs, and capturing local reordering, but they lack variables (e.g. embedding between ne . . .pas in French), have sparsity problems, and lack a strategy for global reordering.",1
"However, in (Quirk and Menezes, 2006), the authors investigate minimum translation units (MTU) which is a refinement over a similar approach by (Banchs et al. , 2005) to eliminate the overlap issue.",1
"David McClosky, Eugene Charniak, and Mark Johnson Brown Laboratory for Linguistic Information Processing (BLLIP) Brown University Providence, RI 02912 {dmcc|ec|mj}@cs.brown.edu Abstract Self-training has been shown capable of improving on state-of-the-art parser performance (McClosky et al., 2006) despite the conventional wisdom on the matter and several studies to the contrary (Charniak, 1997; Steedman et al., 2003).",1
"Its success stories range from parsing (McClosky et al., 2006) to machine translation (Ueffing, 2006).",1
"For English, self-training contributes 0.83% absolute improvement to the PCFG-LA parser, which is comparable to the improvement obtained from using semi-supervised training with the twostage parser in (McClosky et al., 2006).",1
"2 Motivation and Prior Work While several authors have looked at the supervised adaptation case, there are less (and especially less successful) studies on semi-supervised domain adaptation (McClosky et al., 2006; Blitzer et al., 2006; Dredze et al., 2007).",1
"There are only a few successful studies, such as (Ando and Zhang, 2005) for chunking and (McClosky et al., 2006a; McClosky et al., 2006b) on constituency parsing.",1
"Recent work, (McClosky et al. , 2006), has shown that adding many millions of words of machine parsed and reranked LA Times articles does, in fact, improve performance of the parser on the closely related WSJ data.",1
"Furthermore, use of the self-training techniques described in (McClosky et al. , 2006) raise this to 87.8% (an error reduction of 28%) again without any use of labeled Brown data.",1
"In the II, OO, and OI scenarios, (McClosky et al, 2006a; 2006b) succeeded in improving the parser performance only when a reranker was used to reorder the 50-best list of the generative parser, with a seed size of 40K sentences.",1
"Recently, (McClosky et al. , 2006a; McClosky et al. , 2006b) have successfully applied self-training to various parser adaptation scenarios using the reranking parser of (Charniak and Johnson, 2005).",1
"As a result, the good results of (McClosky et al, 2006a; 2006b) with large seed sets do not immediately imply success with small seed sets.",1
"Tighter integration of semantics into the parsing models, possibly in the form of discriminative reranking models (Collins and Koo, 2005; Charniak and Johnson, 2005; McClosky et al., 2006), is a promising way forward in this regard.",1
"We also plan to apply self-training of n-best tagger which successfully boosted the performance of one of the best existing English syntactic parser (McClosky et al. , 2006).",1
The novel idea presented in Strube & Ponzetto (2006) was to induce a semantic network from the Wikipedia categorization graph to compute measures of semantic relatedness.,1
"Recently, Ponzetto and Strube (2006) suggest to mine semantic relatedness from Wikipedia, which can deal with the data sparseness problem suffered by using WordNet.",1
"Riezler and Maxwell (2006) do not achieve higher BLEU scores, but do score better according to human grammaticality judgments for in-coverage cases.",1
Riezler and III (2006) report an improvement in MT grammaticality on a very restricted test set: short sentences parsable by an LFG grammar without back-off rules.,1
"Synchronous binarization (Zhang et al. , 2006) solves this problem by simultaneously binarizing both source and target-sides of a synchronous rule, making sure of contiguous spans on both sides whenever possible.",1
"Recent work by (Zhang et al., 2006) shows a practically ef cient approach that binarizes linguistically SCFG rules when possible.",1
Haghighi and Klein (2006) showed that adding a small set of prototypes to the unlabeled data can improve tagging accuracy significantly.,1
"In particular, (Haghighi and Klein, 2006) presents very strong results using a distributional-similarity module and achieve impressive tagging accuracy while starting with a mere 116 prototypical words.",1
"This type of input information (features + majority label) is a powerful and flexible model for specifying alternative inputs to a classifier, and has been additionally used by Haghighi and Klein (2006).",1
"In particular, we have implemented an unsupervised morphological analyzer that outperforms Goldsmith s (2001) Linguistica and Creutz and Lagus s (2005) Morfessor for our English and Bengali datasets and compares favorably to the bestperforming morphological parsers in MorphoChallenge 20053 (see Dasgupta and Ng (2007)).",1
"Dasgupta and Ng (2007) improves over (Creutz, 2003) by suggesting a simpler approach.",1
"With the in-depth study of opinion mining, researchers committed their efforts for more accurate results: the research of sentiment summarization (Philip et al., 2004; Hu et al., KDD 2004), domain transfer problem of the sentiment analysis (Kanayama et al., 2006; Tan et al., 2007; Blitzer et al., 2007; Tan et al., 2008; Andreevskaia et al., 2008; Tan et al., 2009) and finegrained opinion mining (Hatzivassiloglou et al., 2000; Takamura et al., 2007; Bloom et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2008; Titov et al., 2008) are the main branches of the research of opinion mining.",1
"In addition to the classical window-based technique, some studies investigated the use of lexico-syntactic patterns (e.g., X or Y) to get more accurate co-occurrence statistics (Chilovski and Pantel, 2004; Bollegala et al., 2007).",1
"However, the most interesting work is certainly proposed by (Bollegala et al., 2007) who extract patterns in two steps.",1
"Automated metrics such as BLEU (Papineni et al. , 2002), RED (Akiba et al, 2001), Weighted N-gram model (WNM) (Babych, 2004), syntactic relation / semantic vector model (Rajman and Hartley, 2001) have been shown to correlate closely with scoring or ranking by different human evaluation parameters.",1
"It was found to produce automated scores, which strongly correlate with human judgements about translation fluency (Papineni et al. , 2002).",1
"The state-of-the-art methods for automatic MT evaluation are using an n-gram based metric represented by BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) and its variants.",1
"In addition to the widely used BLEU (Papineni et al. , 2002) and NIST (Doddington, 2002) scores, we also evaluate translation quality with the recently proposed Meteor (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005) and four edit-distance style metrics, Word Error Rate (WER), Positionindependent word Error Rate (PER) (Tillmann et al. , 1997), CDER, which allows block reordering (Leusch et al. , 2006), and Translation Edit Rate (TER) (Snover et al. , 2006).",1
"The translation quality is evaluated using a well-established automatic measure: BLEU score (Papineni et al. , 2002).",1
"A popular metric for evaluating machine translation quality is the Bleu score (Papineni et al. , 2002).",1
"2.1 The BLEU Metric The metric most often used with MERT is BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), where the score of a candidate c against a reference translation r is: BLEU = BP(len(c),len(r))exp( 4summationdisplay n=1 1 4 logpn), where pn is the n-gram precision2 and BP is a brevity penalty meant to penalize short outputs, to discourage improving precision at the expense of recall.",1
"It is the most widely reported metric in MT research, and has been shown to correlate well with human judgment (Papineni et al., 2002; Coughlin, 2003).",1
"The full model yields a stateof-the-art BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) score of 0.8506 on Section 23 of the CCGbank, which is to our knowledge the best score reported to date 410 using a reversible, corpus-engineered grammar.",1
"3.2 Evaluation Criteria Well-established objective evaluation measures like the word error rate (WER), positionindependent word error rate (PER), and the BLEU score (Papineni et al. , 2002) were used to assess the translation quality.",1
"State-of-the-art measures such as BLEU (Papineni et al. , 2002) or NIST (Doddington, 2002) aim at measuring the translation quality rather on the document level1 than on the level of single sentences.",1
"While studies have shown that ratings of MT systems by BLEU and similar metrics correlate well with human judgments (Papineni et al. , 2002; Doddington, 2002), we are not aware of any studies that have shown that corpus-based evaluation metrics of NLG systems are correlated with human judgments; correlation studies have been made of individual components (Bangalore et al. , 2000), but not of systems.",1
"The BLEU metric (Papineni et al. , 2002) in MT has been particularly successful; for example MT05, the 2005 NIST MT evaluation exercise, used BLEU-4 as the only method of evaluation.",1
"Properly calculated BLEU scores have been shown to correlate reliably with human judgments (Papineni et al. , 2002).",1
"Some NLG researchers are impressed by the success of the BLEU evaluation metric (Papineni et al. , 2002) in Machine Translation (MT), which has transformed the MT field by allowing researchers to quickly and cheaply evaluate the impact of new ideas, algorithms, and data sets.",1
"The table also shows the popular BLEU (Papineni et al. , 2002) and NIST2 MT metrics.",1
"3 Previous Work The idea of employing n-gram co-occurrence statistics to score the output of a computer system against one or more desired reference outputs was first successfully implemented in the BLEU metric for machine translation (Papineni et al. , 2002).",1
"4.4.1 N-gram Co-Occurrence Statistics for Answer Extraction N-gram co-occurrence statistics have been successfully used in automatic evaluation (Papineni et al. 2002, Lin and Hovy 2003), and more recently as training criteria in statistical machine translation (Och 2003).",1
"In machine translation, the rankings from the automatic BLEU method (Papineni et al. , 2002) have been shown to correlate well with human evaluation, and it has been widely used since and has even been adapted for summarization (Lin and Hovy, 2003).",1
"1 Introduction With the introduction of the BLEU metric for machine translation evaluation (Papineni et al, 2002), the advantages of doing automatic evaluation for various NLP applications have become increasingly appreciated: they allow for faster implement-evaluate cycles (by by-passing the human evaluation bottleneck), less variation in evaluation performance due to errors in human assessor judgment, and, not least, the possibility of hill-climbing on such metrics in order to improve system performance (Och 2003).",1
"We report results using the well-known automatic evaluation metrics Bleu (Papineni et al. , 2002).",1
"First, we compared our system output to human reference translations using Bleu (Papineni, et al. , 2002), a widelyaccepted objective metric for evaluation of machine translations.",1
"BLEU and NIST have been shown to correlate closely with human judgments in ranking MT systems with different qualities (Papineni et al. , 2002; Doddington, 2002).",1
"One of the most successful metrics for judging machine-generated text is BLEU (Papineni et al. , 2002).",1
"The well-known BLEU (Papineni et al. , 2002) is based on the number of common n-grams between the translation hypothesis and human reference translations of the same sentence.",1
"2 Evaluation Metrics Currently, the most widely used automatic MT evaluation metric is the NIST BLEU-4 (Papineni et al. , 2002).",1
"The translation quality was evaluated using a well-established automatic measure: BLEU score (Papineni et al. , 2002).",1
"Among all the automatic MT evaluation metrics, BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) is the most widely used.",1
"Since human evaluation is costly and difficult to do reliably, a major focus of research has been on automatic measures of MT quality, pioneered by BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) and NIST (Doddington, 2002).",1
"It could be shown that such methods, of which BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) is the most common, can deliver evaluation results that show a high agreement with human judgments (Papineni et al., 2002; Coughlin, 2003; Koehn & Monz, 2006).",1
"High correlation is reported between the BLEU score and human evaluations for translations from Arabic, Chinese, French, and Spanish to English (Papineni et al. , 2002a).",1
"Empirically the BLEU score has a high correlation with human evaluation when N = 4 for English translation evaluations (Papineni et al. , 2002b).",1
"BLEU and NIST have been shown to correlate closely with human judgments in ranking MT systems with different qualities (Papineni et al. , 2002; Doddington, 2002).",1
"1 Introduction Automatic Metrics for machine translation (MT) evaluation have been receiving significant attention in the past two years, since IBM's BLEU metric was proposed and made available (Papineni et al 2002).",1
"The most widely used are Word Error Rate (WER), Position Independent Word Error Rate (PER), the BLEU score (Papineni et al. , 2002) and the NIST score (Doddington, 2002).",1

"The BLEU metric (Papineni et al. , 2002) and the closely related NIST metric (Doddington, 2002) along with WER and PER 48 have been widely used by many machine translation researchers.",1
"1 Introduction In recent years, statistical machine translation have experienced a quantum leap in quality thanks to automatic evaluation (Papineni et al. , 2002) and errorbased optimization (Och, 2003).",1
"The most widely known are the Word Error Rate (WER), the Position independent word Error Rate (PER), the NIST score (Doddington, 2002) and, especially in recent years, the BLEU score (Papineni et al. , 2002) and the Translation Error Rate (TER) (Snover et al. , 2005).",1
"3 Extending Bleu and Ter with Flexible Matching Many widely used metrics like Bleu (Papineni et al., 2002) and Ter (Snover et al., 2006) are based on measuring string level similarity between the reference translation and translation hypothesis, just like Meteor . Most of them, however, depend on finding exact matches between the words in two strings.",1
"After a brief period following the introduction of generally accepted and widely used metrics, BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) and NIST (Doddington, 2002), when it seemed that this persistent problem has finally been solved, the researchers active in the field of machine translation (MT) started to express their worries that although these metrics are simple, fast and able to provide consistent results for a particular system during its development, they are not sufficiently reliable for the comparison of different systems or different language pairs.",1
"A novel approach was described in (Marcu and Echihabi, 2002), which used an unsupervised training technique, extracting relations that were explicitly and unamibiguously signalled and automatically labelling those examples as the training set.",1
"(Turney, 2002) is one of the most famous work that discussed learning polarity from corpus.",1
Turneys (2002) work is perhaps one of the most notable examples of unsupervised polarity classification.,1
"The conceptually simplest approach to this latter problem is probably Turneys (2002), who has obtained interesting results on Task 2 by considering the algebraic sum of the orientations of terms as representative of the orientation of the document they belong to; but more sophisticated approaches arealsopossible (Hatzivassiloglou and Wiebe, 2000; Riloff et al. , 2003; Wilson et al. , 2004).",1
"Turney also reported good result without domain customization (Turney, 2002).",1
Turneys (2002) work is perhaps one of the most notable examples of unsupervised polarity classification.,1
"In our future work we plan to investigate the effect of more sophisticated and, probably, more accurate filtering methods (Fleischman et al. , 2003) on the QA results.",1
"In contrast, the idea of bootstrapping for relation and information extraction was first proposed in (Riloff and Jones, 1999), and successfully applied to the construction of semantic lexicons (Thelen and Riloff, 2002), named entity recognition (Collins and Singer, 1999), extraction of binary relations (Agichtein and Gravano, 2000), and acquisition of structured data for tasks such as Question Answering (Lita and Carbonell, 2004; Fleischman et al. , 2003).",1

"1 Introduction Och (2003) introduced minimum error rate training (MERT) for optimizing feature weights in statistical machine translation (SMT) models, and demonstrated that it produced higher translation quality scores than maximizing the conditional likelihood of a maximum entropy model using the same features.",1
"(2) We note that these posterior probabilities can be computed efficiently for some alignment models such as the HMM (Vogel et al. , 1996; Och and Ney, 2003), Models 1 and 2 (Brown et al. , 1993).",1
"2.2 Unsupervised Parameter Estimation We can perform maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters of this model in a similar fashion to that of Model 4 (Brown et al. , 1993), described thoroughly in (Och and Ney, 2003).",1
"(Och and Ney, 2003) discussed efficient implementation.",1
"The current state-of-the-art is to optimize these parameters with respect to the final evaluation criterion; this is the so-called minimum error rate training (Och, 2003).",1
"The current state-of-the-art is to use minimum error rate training (MERT) as described in (Och, 2003).",1
"For instance, changing the training procedure for word alignment models turned out to be most beneficial; for details see (Och and Ney, 2003).",1
" Using the components of the row-vector bm as feature function values for the candidate translation em (m a16 1,,M), the system prior weights  can easily be trained using the Minimum Error Rate Training described in (Och, 2003).",1

"However, this is not unprecedented: discriminatively weighted generative models have been shown to outperform purely discriminative competitors in various NLP classification tasks (Raina et al., 2004; Toutanova, 2006), and remain the standard approach in statistical translation modeling (Och, 2003).",1
"The remaining six entries were all fully automatic machine translation systems; in fact, they were all phrase-based statistical machine translation system that had been trained on the same parallel corpus and most used Bleubased minimum error rate training (Och, 2003) to optimize the weights of their log linear models feature functions (Och and Ney, 2002).",1
"The statistical machine translation community relies on the Bleu metric for the purposes of evaluating incremental system changes and optimizing systems through minimum error rate training (Och, 2003).",1
Och (2003) has described an efficient exact onedimensional accuracy maximization technique for a similar search problem in machine translation.,1
"Current state of the art machine translation systems (Och, 2003) use phrasal (n-gram) features extracted automatically from parallel corpora.",1
"Target language model probability (weight = 0.5) According to a previous study, the minimum error rate training (MERT) (Och, 2003), which is the optimization of feature weights by maximizing the BLEU score on the development set, can improve the performance of a system.",1
An efficient algorithm for performing this tuning for a larger number of model parameters can be found in Och (2003).,1

"1 Introduction Phrase-based translation models (Marcu and Wong, 2002; Koehn et al. , 2003; Och and Ney, 2004), which go beyond the original IBM translation models (Brown et al. , 1993) 1 by modeling translations of phrases rather than individual words, have been suggested to be the state-of-theart in statistical machine translation by empirical evaluations.",1
"While error-driven training techniques are commonly used to improve the performance of phrasebased translation systems (Chiang, 2005; Och, 2003), this paper presents a novel block sequence translation approach to SMT that is similar to sequential natural language annotation problems 727 such as part-of-speech tagging or shallow parsing, both in modeling and parameter training.",1
Och (2003) has described an ef cient exact one-dimensional error minimization technique for a similar search problem in machine translation.,1
"1 Introduction Raw parallel data need to be preprocessed in the modern phrase-based SMT before they are aligned by alignment algorithms, one of which is the wellknown tool, GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003), for training IBM models (1-4).",1

"By having the advantage of leveraging large parallel corpora, the statistical MT approach outperforms the traditional transfer based approaches in tasks for which adequate parallel corpora is available (Och, 2003).",1
"We wish to minimize this error function, so we select  accordingly: argmin  summationdisplay a E(a)(a, (argmax a p(a, f|e))) (4) Maximizing performance for all of the weights at once is not computationally tractable, but (Och, 2003) has described an efficient one-dimensional search for a similar problem.",1

"Furthermore, end-to-end systems like speech recognizers (Roark et al. , 2004) and automatic translators (Och, 2003) use increasingly sophisticated discriminative models, which generalize well to new data that is drawn from the same distribution as the training data.",1

The search across a dimension uses the efficient method of Och (2003).,1
"Ochs procedure is the most widely-used version of MERT for SMT (Och, 2003).",1
"Although they obtained consistent and stable performance gains for MT, these were inferior to the gains yielded by Ochs procedure in (Och, 2003).",1
"Some recent work on incremental parsing (Collins and Roark, 2004; Shen and Joshi, 2005) showed another way to handle this problem.",1
"Variants of this method have been successfully used in many NLP tasks, like shallow processing (Daume III and Marcu, 2005), parsing (Collins and Roark, 2004; Shen and Joshi, 2005) and word alignment (Moore, 2005).",1
"Incremental top-down and left-corner parsers have been shown to effectively (and efficiently) make use of non-local features from the left-context to yield very high accuracy syntactic parses (Roark, 2001; Henderson, 2003; Collins and Roark, 2004), and we will use such rich models to derive our scores.",1
"2.2 Perceptron-based training To tune the parameters w of the model, we use the averaged perceptron algorithm (Collins, 2002) because of its efficiency and past success on various NLP tasks (Collins and Roark, 2004; Roark et al. , 2004).",1
"Collins and Roark (2004) saw a LFMS improvement of 0.8% over their baseline discriminative parser after adding punctuation features, one of which encoded the sentence-final punctuation.",1

"1 Introduction Statistical parsing models have been shown to be successful in recovering labeled constituencies (Collins, 2003; Charniak and Johnson, 2005; Roark and Collins, 2004) and have also been shown to be adequate in recovering dependency relationships (Collins et al. , 1999; Levy and Manning, 2004; Dubey and Keller, 2003).",1
"Its also worth noting that Collins and Roark (2004) saw a LFMS improvement of 0.8% over their baseline discriminative parser after adding punctuation features, one of which encoded the sentence-final punctuation.",1
"Second, benefits for sentiment analysis can be realized by decomposing the problem into S/O (or neutral versus polar) and polarity classification (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003; Pang and Lee, 2004; Wilson et al., 2005a; Kim and Hovy, 2006).",1
"Recently, graph-based methods have proved useful for a number of NLP and IR tasks such as document re-ranking in ad hoc IR (Kurland and Lee, 2005) and analyzing sentiments in text (Pang and Lee, 2004).",1
"SVM has been shown to be useful for text classification tasks (Joachims, 1998), and has previously given good performance in sentiment classification experiments (Kennedy and Inkpen, 2006; Mullen and Collier, 2004; Pang and Lee, 2004; Pang et al., 2002).",1
"We chose a dataset that would be enjoyable to reannotate: the movie review dataset of (Pang et al. , 2002; Pang and Lee, 2004).3 The dataset consists of 1000 positive and 1000 negative movie reviews obtained from the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) review archive, all written before 2002 by a total of 312 authors, with a cap of 20 reviews per author per 2Taking Ccontrast to be constant means that all rationales are equally valuable.",1
"All reviews were automatically preprocessed to remove both explicit rating indicators and objective sentences; the motivation for the latter step is that it has previously aided positive vs. negative classi cation (Pang and Lee, 2004).",1
"Interestingly, previous sentiment analysis research found that a minimum-cut formulation for the binary subjective/objective distinction yielded good results (Pang and Lee, 2004).",1
"A later study (Pang and Lee, 2004) found that performance increased to 87.2% when considering only those portions of the text deemed to be subjective.",1
"Note that our result on Dataset A is as strong as that obtained by Pang and Lee (2004) via their subjectivity summarization algorithm, which retains only the subjective portions of a document.",1
"Indeed, recent work has shown that benefits can be made by first separating facts from opinions in a document (e.g, Yu and Hatzivassiloglou (2003)) and classifying the polarity based solely on the subjective portions of the document (e.g. , Pang and Lee (2004)).",1
"First, even when sentiment is the desired focus, researchers in sentiment analysis have shown that a two-stage approach is often beneficial, in which subjective instances are distinguished from objective ones, and then the subjective instances are further classified according to polarity (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003; Pang and Lee, 2004; Wilson et al. , 2005; Kim and Hovy, 2006).",1
"Table 1: Datasets 3.3 Establishing a Baseline for a Corpus-based System (CBS) Supervised statistical methods have been very successful in sentiment tagging of texts: on movie review texts they reach accuracies of 85-90% (Aue and Gamon, 2005; Pang and Lee, 2004).",1
"A two-tier scheme (Pang and Lee, 2004) where sentences are  rst classi ed as subjective versus objective, and then applying the sentiment classi er on only the subjective sentences further improves performance.",1
"And 20NG is a collection of approximately 20,000 20-category documents 1 . In sentiment text classification, we also use two data sets: one is the widely used Cornell movie-review dataset2 (Pang and Lee, 2004) and one dataset from product reviews of domain DVD3 (Blitzer et al., 2007).",1
"As has been previously observed and exploited in the NLP literature (Pang and Lee, 2004; Agarwal and Bhattacharyya, 2005; Barzilay and Lapata, 2005), the above optimization function, unlike many others that have been proposed for graph or set partitioning, can be solved exactly in an provably efficient manner via methods for finding minimum cuts in graphs.",1
"Sentence-level subjectivity detection, where training data is easier to obtain than for positive vs. negative classification, has been successfully performed using supervised statistical methods alone (Pang and Lee, 2004) or in combination with a knowledgebased approach (Riloff et al. , 2006).",1
"3 CLaC-NB System: Nave Bayes Supervised statistical methods have been very successful in sentiment tagging of texts and in subjectivity detection at sentence level: on movie review texts they reach an accuracy of 85-90% (Aue and Gamon, 2005; Pang and Lee, 2004) and up to 92% accuracy on classifying movie review snippets into subjective and objective using both Nave Bayes and SVM (Pang and Lee, 2004).",1
"This paper demonstrates several of the characteristics and benefits of SemFrame (Green et al. , 2004; Green and Dorr, 2004), a system that produces such a resource.",1
"6 Discussion Noting that adding latent features to nonterminals in unlexicalized context-free parsing has been very successful (Chiang and Bikel, 2002; Matsuzaki et al. , 2005; Prescher, 2005; Dreyer and Eisner, 2006; Petrov et al. , 2006), we were surprised not to see a 3Czech experiments were not done, since the number of features (more than 14 million) was too high to multiply out by clusters.",1
"2 Parsing Model The Berkeley parser (Petrov et al., 2006; Petrov and Klein, 2007) is an efficient and effective parser that introduces latent annotations (Matsuzaki et al., 2005) to refine syntactic categories to learn better PCFG grammars.",1
"This was recently followed by (Matsuzaki et al., 2005; Petrov et al., 2006) who introduce state-of-the-art nearly unlexicalized PCFG parsers.",1
The latent-annotation model (Matsuzaki et al. 2005; Petrov et al. 2006) is one of the most effective un-lexicalized models.,1
"1 Introduction When data have distinct sub-structures, models exploiting latent variables are advantageous in learning (Matsuzaki et al., 2005; Petrov and Klein, 2007; Blunsom et al., 2008).",1
"Previous work has shown that high-quality unlexicalized PCFGs can be learned from a treebank, either by manual annotation (Klein and Manning, 2003) or automatic state splitting (Matsuzaki et al. , 2005; Petrov et al. , 2006).",1
"Compared to a basic treebank grammar (Charniak, 1996), the grammars of highaccuracy parsers weaken independence assumptions by splitting grammar symbols and rules with either lexical (Charniak, 2000; Collins, 1999) or nonlexical (Klein and Manning, 2003; Matsuzaki et al. , 2005) conditioning information.",1
"As discussed above, all state-of-the-art published methods rely on lexical features for such tasks (Zhang et al., 2001; Sha and Pereira, 2003; Finkel et al., 2005; Ratinov and Roth, 2009).",1
"Recent work includes improved model variants (e.g. , Jiao et al. , 2006; Okanohara et al. , 2006) and applications such as web data extraction (Pinto et al. , 2003), scientific citation extraction (Peng and McCallum, 2004), and word alignment (Blunsom and Cohn, 2006).",1

"Currently, the best-performing English NP interpretation methods in computational linguistics focus mostly on two consecutive noun instances (noun compounds) and are either (weakly) supervised, knowledge-intensive (Rosario and Hearst, 2001), (Rosario et al. , 2002), (Moldovan et al. , 2004), (Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2006), (Pennacchiotti and Pantel, 2006), (Kim and Baldwin, 2006), (Snow et al. , 2006), (Girju et al. , 2005; Girju et al. , 2006), or use statistical models on large collections of unlabeled data (Berland and Charniak, 1999), (Lapata and Keller, 2004), (Nakov and Hearst, 2005), (Turney, 2006).",1
"This increase of probabilities is defined as multiplicative change (N) as follows: (N) = P(E|Tprime)/P(E|T) (2) The main innovation of the model in (Snow et al., 2006) is the possibility of adding at each step the best relation N = {Ri,j}as well as N = I(Ri,j) that is Ri,j with all the relations by the existing taxonomy.",1
"Automatically creating or extending taxonomies for specific domains is then a very interesting area of research (OSullivan et al., 1995; Magnini and Speranza, 2001; Snow et al., 2006).",1
"Because of this property, vector space models have been used successfully both in computational linguistics (Manning et al., 2008; Snow et al., 2006; Gorman and Curran, 2006; Schutze, 1998) and in cognitive science (Landauer and Dumais, 1997; Lowe and McDonald, 2000; McDonald and Ramscar, 2001).",1

"1 Introduction One of the major approaches to disambiguate word senses is supervised learning (Gale et al. , 1992), (Yarowsky, 1992), (Bruce and Janyce, 1994), (Miller et al. , 1994), (Niwa and Nitta, 1994), (Luk, 1995), (Ng and Lee, 1996), (Wilks and Stevenson, 1998).",1
2.1 The Yarowsky algorithm Yarowsky (1995) sparked considerable interest in bootstrapping with his successful method for word sense disambiguation.,1
"A variety of classifiers have been employed for this task (see Mooney [1996] and Ide and Veronis [1998] for overviews), the most popular being decision lists (Yarowsky 1994, 1995) and naive Bayesian classifiers (Pedersen 2000; Ng 1997; Pedersen and Bruce 1998; Mooney 1996; Cucerzan and Yarowsky 2002).",1
The Yarowsky (1995) algorithm was one of the first bootstrapping algorithms to become widely known in computational linguistics.,1
Yarowsky has proposed an algorithm that requires as little user input as one seed word per sense to start the training process (Yarowsky 1995).,1
"The best example of such an approach is (Yarowsky, 1995), who proposes a method that automatically identifies collocations that are indicative of the sense of a word, and uses those to iteratively label more examples.",1
"To alleviate this effort, various semi-supervised learning algorithms such as self-training (Yarowsky, 1995), cotraining (Blum and Mitchell, 1998; Goldman and Zhou, 2000), transductive SVM (Joachims, 1999) and many others have been proposed and successfully applied under different assumptions and settings.",1
"This method, initially proposed by (Yarowsky, 1995), was successfully evaluated in the context of the SENSEVAL framework (Mihalcea, 2002).",1
"Among the various knowledge-based (Lesk, 1986; Galley and McKeown, 2003; Navigli and Velardi, 2005) and data-driven (Yarowsky, 1995; Ng and Lee, 1996; Pedersen, 2001) word sense disambiguation methods that have been proposed to date, supervised systems have been constantly observed as leading to the highest performance.",1
"Disambiguation of a limited number of words is not hard, and necessary context information can be carefully collected and hand-crafted to achieve high disambiguation accuracy as shown in (Yarowsky, 1995).",1
"In order to overcome this, some unsupervised learning methods and minimally-supervised methods, e.g., (Yarowsky, 1995; Yarowsky and Wicentowski, 2000), have been proposed.",1
"Some tasks can thrive on a nearly pure diet of unlabeled data (Yarowsky, 1995; Collins and Singer, 1999; Cucerzan and Yarowsky, 2003).",1
"3.2 Comparison between SVM, Bootstrapping and LP For WSD, SVM is one of the state of the art supervised learning algorithms (Mihalcea et al. , 2004), while bootstrapping is one of the state of the art semi-supervised learning algorithms (Li and Li, 2004; Yarowsky, 1995).",1
"5.1 Comparison to self-training For completeness, we also compared our results to the self-learning algorithm, which has commonly been referred to as bootstrapping in natural language processing and originally popularized by the work of Yarowsky in word sense disambiguation (Abney 2004; Yarowsky 1995).",1
"Annealing  resembles the popular bootstrapping technique (Yarowsky, 1995), which starts out aiming for high precision, and gradually improves coverage over time.",1
"(Yarowsky, 1995) demonstrated that semi-supervised WSD could be successful.",1
"In order to overcome this problem, we look to the bootstrapping method outlined in (Yarowsky, 1995).",1
One of the most notable examples is Yarowskys (1995) bootstrapping algorithm for word sense disambiguation.,1
"Extracting semantic information from word co-occurrence statistics has been effective, particularly for sense disambiguation (Schiitze, 1992; Gale et al. , 1992; Yarowsky, 1995).",1
"Decision lists have already been successfully applied to lexical ambiguity resolution by (Yarowsky, 1995) where they perfromed well.",1
"Some of the best results were reported in (Yarowsky, 1995) who uses a large training corpus.",1
"They have been successfully applied to accent restoration, word"" sense disambiguation 209 and homograph disambiguation (Yarowsky, 1994; 1995; 1996).",1
"To overcome this problem, unsupervised learning methods using huge unlabeled data to boost the performance of rules learned by small labeled data have been proposed recently(Blum and Mitchell, 1998)(Yarowsky, 1995)(Park et al. , 2000)(Li and Li, 2002).",1
"To solve this problem, we adopt an idea one sense per collocation which was introduced in word sense disambiguation research (Yarowsky, 1995).",1
"The approach is very general and modular and can work in conjunction with a number of learning strategies for word sense disambiguation (Yarowsky, 1995; Li and Li, 2002).",1
"4.1 Methods and Parameters DL: On Senseval-2 data, we observed that DL improved significantly its performance with a smoothing technique based on (Yarowsky, 1995a).",1
"We also note that there are a number of bootstrapping methods successfully applied to text  e.g., word sense disambiguation (Yarowsky, 1995), named entity instance classification (Collins and Singer, 1999), and the extraction of parts word given the whole word (Berland and Charniak, 1999).",1
"7 Related Work Unannotated texts have been used successfully for a variety of NLP tasks, including named entity recognition (Collins and Singer, 1999), subjectivity classification (Wiebe and Riloff, 2005), text classification (Nigam et al. , 2000), and word sense disambiguation (Yarowsky, 1995).",1
The notion that nouns have only one sense per discourse/collocation was also exploited by Yarowsky (1995) in his seminal work on bootstrapping for word sense disambiguation.,1
Yarowsky (1995) successfully used this observation as an approximate annotation technique in an unsupervised WSD model.,1
"(1992b) has proved to be a simple yet powerful observation and has been successfully used in word sense disambiguation (WSD) and related tasks (e.g., Yarowsky (1995); Agirre and Rigau The author was partially funded by GALE DARPA Contract No.",1
"Unsupervised algorit~m~ such as (Yarowsky, 1995) have reported good accuracy that rivals that of supervised algorithms.",1
"The best examples of this approach has been the resent work of Yarowsky (Yarowsky, 1992), (Yarowsky, 1993), (Yarowsky, 1995).",1
"While (Yarowsky, 1995) does not discuss distinguishing more than 2 senses of a word, there is no immediate reason to doubt that the ""one sense per collocation"" rule (Yarowsky, 1993) would still hold for a larger number of senses.",1
"(Yarowsky, 1995) compares his method to (Schiitze, 1992) and shows that for four words the former performs significantly better in distinguishing between two senses.",1
"(Yarowsky, 1995), whose training corpus for the noun drug was 9 times bigger than that of Karov and Edelman, reports 91.4% correct performance improved to impressive 93.9% when using the ""one sense per discourse"" constraint.",1
"Among them, the unsupervised algorithm using decisiontrees (Yarowsky, 1995) has achieved promising performance.",1
"Also, in a, sta.te-ofthe-a.rt English pa.rser (Collins, 1997) only the words tha, t occur more tha,n d times in training data.",1
"Substantial improvements have been made to parse western language such as English, and many powerful models have been proposed (Brill 1993, Collins 1997).",1
"Several general-purpose off-the-shelf (OTS) parsers have become widely available (Lin, 1994; Collins, 1997).",1
"On the other hand, the best available parsers trained on the Penn Treebank, those of Collins (1997) and Charniak (2000), use statistical models for disambiguation that make crucial use of dependency relations.",1
"Moreover, the deterministic dependency parser of Yamada and Matsumoto (2003), when trained on the Penn Treebank, gives a dependency accuracy that is almost as good as that of Collins (1997) and Charniak (2000).",1
"All state-of-the-art wide-coverage parsers relax this assumption in some way, for instance by (i) changing the parser in step (3), such that the application of rules is conditioned on other steps in the derivation process (Collins, 1997; Charniak, 1997), or by (ii) enriching the nonterminal labels in step (1) with context-information (Johnson, 1998; Klein and Manning, 2003), along with suitable backtransforms in step (4).",1
"Lexicalized PCFGs use the structural features on the lexical head of phrasal node in a tree, and get significant improvements for parsing (Collins, 1997; Charniak, 1997; Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2000).",1
"To compare the output of their shallow parser with the output of the well-known Collins (1997) parser, Li and Roth applied the chunklink conversion script to extract the shallow constituents from the output of the Collins parser on WSJ section 00.",1
"The parsers with the highest published broad-coverage parsing accuracy, which include Charniak (1997, 2000), Collins (1997, 1999), and Ratnaparkhi (1997), all utilize simple and straightforward statistically based search heuristics, pruning the search-space quite dramatically.",1
"Introduction Michael Collins (1996, 1997, 1999) parsing models have been quite influential in the field of natural language processing.",1
"First, several of the best-performing parsers on the WSJ treebank (e.g. , Ratnaparkhi 1997; Charniak 1997, 2000; Collins 1997, 1999; Henderson 2003) are cases of history-based models.",1
"3.2 Statistical Learning Model 3.2.1 Nave Bayes Learning Nave Bayes learning has been widely used in natural language processing with good results such as statistical syntactic parsing (Collins, 1997; Charniak, 1997), hidden language understanding (Miller et al. , 1994).",1
"Such word-based lexicalizations of probability models are used successfully in the statistical parsing models of, e.g., Collins (1997), Charniak (1997), or Ratnaparkhi (1997).",1
"Head-lexicalized stochastic grammars have recently become increasingly popular (see Collins 1997, 1999; Charniak 1997, 2000).",1
"Lexicalization can increase parsing performance dramatically for English (Carroll and Rooth, 1998; Charniak, 1997, 2000; Collins, 1997), and the lexicalized model proposed by Collins (1997) has been successfully applied to Czech (Collins et al. , 1999) and Chinese (Bikel and Chiang, 2000).",1
(1999) and Bikel and Chiang (2000) has demonstrated the applicability of the Collins (1997) model for Czech and Chinese.,1
"However, the learning curve for Negra (see Figure 1) indicates that the performance of the Collins (1997) model is stable, even for small training sets.",1
"3 Probabilistic Parsing Models 3.1 Probabilistic Context-Free Grammars Lexicalization has been shown to improve parsing performance for the Penn Treebank (e.g. , Carroll and Rooth 1998; Charniak 1997, 2000; Collins 1997).",1
"1 Introduction Treebank-based probabilistic parsing has been the subject of intensive research over the past few years, resulting in parsing models that achieve both broad coverage and high parsing accuracy (e.g. , Collins 1997; Charniak 2000).",1
"As a side product, we find empirical evidence to suggest that the effectiveness of rule lexicalization techniques (Collins, 1997; Simaan, 2000) and parent annotation techniques (Klein and Manning, 2003) is due to the fact that both lead to a reduction in perplexity in the automata induced from training corpora.",1
"They are central to many parsing models (Charniak, 1997; Collins, 1997, 2000; Eisner, 1996), and despite their simplicity n-gram models have been very successful.",1
"We employ a robust statistical parser (Collins, 1997) to determine the constituent structure for each sentence, from which subjects (s), objects (o), and relations other than subject or object (x) are identified.",1
"Previous work for English (e.g. , Magerman, 1995; Collins, 1997) has shown that lexicalization leads to a sizable improvement in parsing performance.",1
"Some of the more popular and more accurate of these approaches to data-driven parsing (Charniak, 2000; Collins, 1997; Klein and Manning, 2002) have been based on generative models that are closely related to probabilistic contextfree grammars.",1
"Parsing models have been developed for different languages and state-of-the-art results have been reported for, e.g., English (Collins, 1997; Charniak, 2000).",1
"Several recent real-world parsers have improved state-of-the-art parsing accuracy by relying on probabilistic or weighted versions of bilexical grammars (Alshawi, 1996; Eisner, 1996; Charniak, 1997; Collins, 1997).",1
"The success of recent high-quality parsers (Charniak, 1997; Collins, 1997) relies on the availability of such treebank corpora.",1
"We choose those sections because several state-of-thwart parsers (Collins, 1997; Ratnaparkhi, 1998; Charniak, 1997) are trained on Section 2-21 and tested on Section 23.",1
"However, since work in this direction has started, a significant progress has also been made in the research on statistical learning of full parsers, both in terms of accuracy and processing time (Charniak, 1997b; Charniak, 1997a; Collins, 1997; Ratnaparkhi, 1997).",1
"For the full parser, we use the one developed by Michael Collins (Collins, 1996; Collins, 1997)  one of the most accurate full parsers around.",1
"2.1 Lexicalized parse trees The first successful work on syntactic disambiguation was based on lexicalized probabilistic context-free grammar (LPCFG) (Collins, 1997; Charniak, 1997).",1
"The creation of the Penn English Treebank (Marcus et al. , 1993), a syntactically interpreted corpus, played a crucial role in the advances in natural language parsing technology (Collins, 1997; Collins, 2000; Charniak, 2000) for English.",1

"Of particular interest are lexicalized parsing models such as the ones developed by Collins (1996, 1997) and Carroll and Rooth (1998).",1
"2 Head Lexicalization As previously shown (Charniak (1997), Collins (1997), Carroll and Rooth (1998), etc.), ContextFree Grammars (CFGs) can be transformed to lexicalized CFGs, provided that a head-marking scheme for rules is given.",1
"Although state-of-the-art statistical parsers (Collins, 1997; Charniak, 2000) are more accurate, the simplicity and efficiency of deterministic parsers make them attractive in a number of situations requiring fast, light-weight parsing, or parsing of large amounts of data.",1
"1 Introduction There has been a great deal of progress in statistical parsing in the past decade (Collins, 1996; Collins, 1997; Chaniak, 2000).",1
"1 Introduction Over the past decade, there has been tremendous progress on learning parsing models from treebank data (Collins, 1997; Charniak, 2000; Wang et al. , 2005; McDonald et al. , 2005).",1
"It is interesting to note that, while the study of how the granularity of context-free grammars (CFG) affects the performance of a parser (e.g. in the form 86 n1:IP [=] n2:NP [SUBJ=] n4:NR [=] GSC4ES JiangZemin n3:VP [=] n5:VV [=] ESDO interview n6:NP [OBJ=] n7:NR [ADJUNCT] AIC1 Thai n8:NN [=] D3D2 president f1             PRED ESDO SUBJ f2  PRED GSC4ESNTYPE proper NUM sg   OBJ f3       PRED D3D2 NTYPE common NUM sg ADJUNCT   f4  PRED AIC1NTYPE proper NUM sg                         : N  F (n1)=(n3)=(n5)=f1 (n2)=(n4)=f2 (n6)=(n8)=f3 (n7)=f4 Figure 1: Cand f-structures with  links for the sentence GSC4ESESDOAIC1D3D2 of grammar transforms (Johnson, 1998) and lexicalisation (Collins, 1997)) has attracted substantial attention, to our knowledge, there has been a lot less research on this subject for surface realisation, a process that is generally regarded as the reverse process of parsing.",1

"In 2004, Conroy (Conroy, 2004) tested Maximal Marginal Relevance (Goldstein et al. , 2000) as well as QR decomposition.",1
"To avoid this problem, we adopt cross-validation training as used in Collins (2002b).",1
"With non-local features, we cannot use efcient procedures such as forward-backward procedures and the Viterbi algorithm that are required in training CRFs (Lafferty et al. , 2001) and perceptrons (Collins, 2002a).",1
"Discriminative methods such as Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al. , 2001), Semi-Markov Random Fields (Sarawagi and Cohen, 2004), and perceptrons (Collins, 2002a) have been popular approaches for sequence labeling because of their excellent performance, which is mainly due to their ability to incorporate many kinds of overlapping and non-independent features.",1
"In our preliminary experiments, we used a Support Vector Machine (SVM) ranker (Joachims, 2002) to learn the structured classi er.2 We also in1See e.g. Collins (2002) for a popular training algorithm.",1
"The Perceptron style for natural language processing problems as initially proposed by (Collins, 2002) can provide state of the art results on various domains including text chunking, syntactic parsing, etc. The main drawback of the Perceptron style algorithm is that it does not have a mechanism for attaining the maximize margin of the training data.",1
"The technique of averaging was introduced in the context of perceptrons as an approximation to taking a vote among all the models traversed during training, and has been shown to work well in practice (Freund and Schapire, 1999; Collins, 2002).",1

"We can credit DUC with the emergence of automatic methods for evaluation such as ROUGE (Lin and Hovy, 2003; Lin, 2004) which allow quick measurement of systems during development and enable evaluation of larger amounts of data.",1
"Two metrics have become quite popular in multi-document summarization, namely the Pyramid method (Nenkova and Passonneau, 2004b) and ROUGE (Lin, 2004).",1
"The use of dependencies in MT evaluation has not been extensively researched before (one exception here would be Liu and Gildea (2005)), and requires more research to improve it, but the method shows potential to become an accurate evaluation metric.",1
"Other well-known metrics are WER (Nieen et al., 2000), NIST (Doddington, 2002), GTM (Melamed et al., 2003), ROUGE (Lin and Och, 2004a), METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005), and TER (Snover et al., 2006), just to name a few.",1
"It has been argued that METEOR correlates better with human judgment due to higher weight on recall than precision (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005).",1
"The results show that, as compared to BLEU, several recently proposed metrics such as Semantic-role overlap (Gimenez and Marquez, 2007), ParaEval-recall (Zhou et al., 2006), and METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005) achieve higher correlation.",1
"In an experiment on 16,800 sentences of Chinese-English newswire text with segment-level human evaluation from the Linguistic Data Consortium?s (LDC) Multiple Translation project, we compare the LFG-based evaluation method with other popular metrics like BLEU, NIST, General Text Matcher (GTM) (Turian et al. , 2003), Translation Error Rate (TER) (Snover et al. , 2006)1, and METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005), and we show that combining dependency representations with synonyms leads to a more accurate evaluation that correlates better with human judgment.",1

"Among these techniques, SCL (Structural Correspondence Learning) (Blitzer et al., 2006) is regarded as a promising method to tackle transfer-learning problem.",1
"2 Previous Work So far, Structural Correspondence Learning has been applied successfully to PoS tagging and Sentiment Analysis (Blitzer et al., 2006; Blitzer et al., 2007).",1
"This algorithm appears fairly widely known: it was described by Goodman (1998) and Finkel et al (2006) and used by Ding et al (2005), and is very similar to other dynamic programming algorithms for CFGs, so we only summarize it here.",1
"2 Related Work To model the syntactic transformation process, researchers in these fieldsespecially in machine translationhave developed powerful grammatical formalisms and statistical models for representing and learning these tree-to-tree relations (Wu and Wong, 1998; Eisner, 2003; Gildea, 2003; Melamed, 2004; Ding and Palmer, 2005; Quirk et al. , 2005; Galley et al. , 2006; Smith and Eisner, 2006, inter alia).",1

"When we run our classifiers on resource-tight environments such as cell-phones, we can use a random feature mixing technique (Ganchev and Dredze, 2008) or a memory-efficient trie implementation based on a succinct data structure (Jacobson, 1989; Delpratt et al., 2006) to reduce required memory usage.",1
"This means that the 1)roblem of recognizing named entities in those cases can be solved by incorporating techniques of base noun phrase chunking (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995).",1
"Ramshaw and Marcus (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995) successflflly applied Eric Brill's transformation-based learning method to the chunking problem.",1
"(Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995) shows that baseNP recognition (Fz=I =92.0) is easier than finding both NP and VP chunks (Fz=1=88.1) and that increasing the size of the training data increases the performance on the test set.",1
"It performed slightly worse on baseNP recognition than the (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995) experiments (Fz=1=91.6).",1
"The IOB1 format, introduced in (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995), consistently (:ame out as the best format.",1
"(l~mshaw and Marcus, 1995) have introduced a ""convenient"" data representation for chunking by converting it to a tagging task.",1
"The pioneering work of Ramshaw and Marcus (1995) introduced NP chunking as a machine-learning problem, with standard datasets and evaluation metrics.",1
"The simplest one is the BIO representation scheme (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995), where a B denotes the first item of an element and an I any non-initial item, and a syllable with tag O is not a part of any element.",1
"4.2 Support Vector Machines We chose to adopt a tagging perspective for the Simple NP chunking task, in which each word is to be tagged as either B, I or O depending on wether it is in the Beginning, Inside, or Outside of the given chunk, an approach first taken by Ramshaw and Marcus (1995), and which has become the de-facto standard for this task.",1
"Following Ramshaw and Marcus (1995), the current dominant approach is formulating chunking as a classification task, in which each word is classified as the (B)eginning, (I)nside or (O)outside of a chunk.",1
"Among the machine learning algorithms studied, rule based systems have proven effective on many natural language processing tasks, including part-of-speech tagging (Brill, 1995; Ramshaw and Marcus, 1994), spelling correction (Mangu and Brill, 1997), word-sense disambiguation (Gale et al. , 1992), message understanding (Day et al. , 1997), discourse tagging (Samuel et al. , 1998), accent restoration (Yarowsky, 1994), prepositional-phrase attachment (Brill and Resnik, 1994) and base noun phrase identification (Ramshaw and Marcus, In Press; Cardie and Pierce, 1998; Veenstra, 1998; Argamon et al. , 1998).",1
"4 Data and Evaluation For the CoNLL shared task, we have chosen to work with the same sections of the Penn Treebank as the widely used data set for base noun phrase recognition (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995): WSJ sections 15-18 of the Penn Treebank as training material and section 20 as test material 3.",1
"Thus, over the past few years, along with advances in the use of learning and statistical methods for acquisition of full parsers (Collins, 1997; Charniak, 1997a; Charniak, 1997b; Ratnaparkhi, 1997), significant progress has been made on the use of statistical learning methods to recognize shallow parsing patterns  syntactic phrases or words that participate in a syntactic relationship (Church, 1988; Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995; Argamon et al. , 1998; Cardie and Pierce, 1998; Munoz et al. , 1999; Punyakanok and Roth, 2001; Buchholz et al. , 1999; Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz, 2000).",1
"Recent comparisons of approaches that can be trained on corpora (van Halteren et al. , 1998; Volk and Schneider, 1998) have shown that in most cases statistical aproaches (Cutting et al. , 1992; Schmid, 1995; Ratnaparkhi, 1996) yield better results than finite-state, rule-based, or memory-based taggers (Brill, 1993; Daelemans et al. , 1996).",1
"We have chosen the Maximum Entropy tagger (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) for a comparison with our universal tagger, since it achieved (by a small margin) the best overall result on Slovene as reported there (86.360% on all tokens) of taggers available to us (MBT, the best overall, was not freely available to us at the time of writing).",1
"a.2 Maximum-entropy method The maximum-entropy method is useful with sparse data conditions and has been used by many researchers (Berger et al. , 1996; Ratnaparkhi, 1996; Ratnaparkhi, 1997; Borthwick el; al. , 1998; Uchimoto et al. , 1999).",1
"The state-of-theart systems have achieved an accuracy of 97% for English on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus (which contains 4.5M words) using various models (Brants, 2000; Ratnaparkhi, 1996; Thede and Harper, 1999).",1
"Hidden Markov models are simple and effective, but unlike discriminative models, such as Maximum Entropy models (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) and Conditional Random Fields (John Lafferty, 2001), they have more difficulty utilizing a rich set of conditionally dependent features.",1
A key component of the parsing system is a Maximum Entropy CCG supertagger (Ratnaparkhi 1996; Curran and Clark 2003) which assigns lexical categories to words in a sentence.,1
"Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) principle has been successfully applied in many classification and tagging tasks (Ratnaparkhi, 1996; K. Nigam and A.McCallum, 1999; A. McCallum and Pereira, 2000).",1
"(Hakkani-Tur et al. , 2000)), and Basque (Ezeiza et al. , 1998), which pose quite different and in the end less severe problems, there have been attempts at solving this problem for some of the highly inflectional European languages, such as (Daelemans et al. , 1996), (Erjavec et al. , 1999) (Slovenian), (Hajic and Hladka, 1997), (Hajic and Hladka, 1998) (Czech) and (Hajic, 2000) (five Central and Eastern European languages), but so far no system has reached in the absolute terms a performance comparable to English tagging (such as (Ratnaparkhi, 1996)), which stands around or above 97%.",1
"It has been used in a variety of difficult classification tasks such as part-of-speech tagging (Ratnaparkhi, 1996), prepositional phrase attachment (Ratnaparkhi et al. , 1994) and named entity tagging (Borthwick et al. , 1998), and achieves state of the art performance.",1

"The most notable of these include the trigram HMM tagger (Brants, 2000), maximum entropy tagger (Ratnaparkhi, 1996), transformation-based tagger (Brill, 1995), and cyclic dependency networks (Toutanova et al. , 2003).",1
"This method led to improvement in the decoding speed as well as the output accuracy for English POS tagging (Ratnaparkhi, 1996).",1
"It worked well for word segmentation alone (Zhang and Clark, 2007), even with an agenda size as small as 8, and a simple beam search algorithm also works well for POS tagging (Ratnaparkhi, 1996).",1
"Their idea has proven effective for estimating the statistics of unknown words in previous studies (Ratnaparkhi, 1996; Nagata, 1999; Nakagawa, 2004).",1
"To improve the unknown word model, featurebased approach such as the maximum entropy method (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) might be useful, because we don't have to divide the training data into several disjoint sets (like we did by part of speech and word type) and we can incorporate more linguistic and morphological knowledge into the same probabilistic framework.",1

"Support Vector Machines (SVMs) (Vapnik, 1995) and Maximum Entropy (ME) method (Berger et al. , 1996) are powerful learning methods that satisfy such requirements, and are applied successfully to other NLP tasks (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2000; Nakagawa et al. , 2001; Ratnaparkhi, 1996).",1

"1 Introduction The maximum entropy model (Berger et al. , 1996; Pietra et al. , 1997) has attained great popularity in the NLP field due to its power, robustness, and successful performance in various NLP tasks (Ratnaparkhi, 1996; Nigam et al. , 1999; Borthwick, 1999).",1
"This approach allows to combine strengths of generality of context attributes as in n-gram models (Brants, 2000; Megyesi, 2001) with their specificity as for binary features in MaxEnt taggers (Ratnaparkhi, 1996; Hajic and Hladk, 1998).",1

"Inside-out alignments (Wu, 1997), such as the one in Example 1.3, cannot be induced by any of these theories; in fact, there seems to be no useful synchronous grammar formalisms available that handle inside-out alignments, with the possible exceptions of synchronous tree-adjoining grammars (Shieber and Schabes, 1990), Bertsch and Nederhof (2001) and generalized multitext grammars (Melamed et al., 2004), which are all way more complex than ITG, STSG and (2,2)-BRCG.",2

"Other statistical machine translation systems such as (Wu, 1997) and (Alshawi et al. , 2000) also produce a tree a15 given a sentence a16 . Their models are based on mechanisms that generate two languages at the same time, so an English tree a15 is obtained as a subproduct of parsing a16 . However, their use of the LM is not mathematically motivated, since their models do not decompose into Pa4a5a2a9a8a3a10a6 and a12a14a4a5a3a7a6 unlike the noisy channel model.",2
Wu (1997) provides anecdotal evidence that only incorrect alignments are eliminated by ITG constraints.,2
"Synchronous grammar formalisms that are capable of modeling such complex relationships while maintaining the context-free property in each language have been proposed for many years, (Aho and Ullman, 1972; Wu, 1997; Yamada and Knight, 2001; Melamed, 2003; Chiang, 2005), but have not been scaled to large corpora and long sentences until recently.",2

"The work reported in Wu (1997), which uses an inside-outside type of training algorithm to learn statistical contextfree transduction, has a similar motivation to the current work, but the models we describe here, being fully lexical, are more suitable for direct statistical modelling.",2
"An alternative method (Wu, 1997) makes decisions at the end but has a high computational requirement.",2
"Besides, our model, as being linguistically motivated, is also more expressive than the formally syntax-based models of Chiang (2005) and Wu (1997).",2
"While the idea of exploiting multiple news reports for paraphrase acquisition is not new, previous efforts (for example, Shinyama et al. 2002; Barzilay and Lee 2003) have been restricted to at most two news sources.",2

"Table 2: Figures about clustering algorithms Algorithm # Sentences/# Clusters S-HAC 6,23 C-HAC 2,17 QT 2,32 EM 4,16 In fact, table 2 shows that most of the clusters have less than 6 sentences which leads to question the results presented by (Barzilay & Lee, 2003) who only keep the clusters that contain more than 10 sentences.",2
"With these linguistic annotations, we expect the LABTG to address two traditional issues of standard phrase-based SMT (Koehn et al., 2003) in a more effective manner.",2
"Such a quasi-syntactic structure can naturally capture the reordering of phrases that is not directly modeled by a conventional phrase-based approach (Koehn et al. , 2003).",2
"1 Introduction Statistical phrase-based systems (Och and Ney, 2004; Koehn et al., 2003) have consistently delivered state-of-the-art performance in recent machine translation evaluations, yet these systems remain weak at handling word order changes.",2
"In contrast, standard phrase-based models (Koehn et al., 2003) assume a mostly monotone mapping between source and target, and therefore cannot adequately model these phenomena.",2
"1 Introduction Phrase-based systems, flat and hierarchical alike (Koehn et al., 2003; Koehn, 2004b; Koehn et al., 2007; Chiang, 2005; Chiang, 2007), have achieved a much better translation coverage than wordbased ones (Brown et al., 1993), but untranslated words remain a major problem in SMT.",2
"The problem is typically presented in log-space, which simplifies computations, but otherwise does not change the problem due to the monotonicity of the log function (hm = log hprimem) log p(t|s) = summationdisplay m m hm(t,s) (3) Phrase-based models (Koehn et al., 2003) are limited to the mapping of small contiguous chunks of text.",2
"However, reordering models in traditional phrase-based systems are not sufficient to treat such complex cases when we translate long sentences (Koehn et al, 2003).",2
"For comparison purposes, three additional heuristically-induced alignments are generated for each system: (1) Intersection of both directions (Aligner(int)); (2) Union of both directions (Aligner(union)); and (3) The previously bestknown heuristic combination approach called growdiag-final (Koehn et al. , 2003) (Aligner(gdf)).",2
"Like WASP1, the phrase extraction algorithm of PHARAOH is based on the output of a word alignment model such as GIZA++ (Koehn et al. , 2003), which performs poorly when applied directly to MRLs (Section 3.2).",2
"The process of phrase extraction is difficult to optimize in a non-discriminative setting: many heuristics have been proposed (Koehn et al. , 2003), but it is not obvious which one should be chosen for a given language pair.",2
"1 Introduction Currently, most of the phrase-based statistical machine translation (PBSMT) models (Marcu and Wong, 2002; Koehn et al., 2003) adopt full matching strategy for phrase translation, which means that a phrase pair (tildewidef,tildewidee) can be used for translating a source phrase f, only if tildewidef = f. Due to lack of generalization ability, the full matching strategy has some limitations.",2
"In such a process, original phrase-based decoding (Koehn et al., 2003) does not take advantage of any linguistic analysis, which, however, is broadly used in rule-based approaches.",2
"It has the advantage of naturally capturing local reorderings and is shown to outperform word-based machine translation (Koehn et al. , 2003).",2
"2 Previous Work It is helpful to compare this approach with recent efforts in statistical MT. Phrase-based models (Koehn et al. , 2003; Och and Ney, 2004) are good at learning local translations that are pairs of (consecutive) sub-strings, but often insufficient in modeling the reorderings of phrases themselves, especially between language pairs with very different word-order.",2
"1 Introduction Translations tables in Phrase-based Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) are often built on the basis of Maximum-likelihood Estimation (MLE), being one of the major limitations of this approach that the source sentence context in which phrases occur is completely ignored (Koehn et al. , 2003).",2
"In such tasks, feature calculation is also very expensive in terms of time required; huge sets of extracted rules must be sorted in two directions for relative frequency calculation of such features as the translation probability p(f|e) and reverse translation probability p(e|f) (Koehn et al., 2003).",2
"While the amount of parallel data required to build such systems is orders of magnitude smaller than corresponding phrase based statistical systems (Koehn et al., 2003), the variety of linguistic annotation required is greater.",2
"1 Introduction The dominance of traditional phrase-based statistical machine translation (PBSMT) models (Koehn et al., 2003) has recently been challenged by the development and improvement of a number of new models that explicity take into account the syntax of the sentences being translated.",2
"This implies that the complexity of structure divergence between two languages is higher than suggested in literature (Fox, 2002; Galley et al., 2004).",2
"Current tree-based models that integrate linguistics and statistics, such as GHKM (Galley et al., 2004), are not able to generalize well from a single phrase pair.",2
"Finally, we show that our contextually richer rules provide a 3.63 BLEU point increase over those of (Galley et al. , 2004).",2
"We presented some theoretical arguments for not limiting extraction to minimal rules, validated them on concrete examples, and presented experiments showing that contextually richer rules provide a 3.63 BLEU point increase over the minimal rules of (Galley et al. , 2004).",2
"However, many of these models are not applicable to parallel treebanks because they assume translation units where either the source text, the target text or both are represented as word sequences without any syntactic structure (Galley et al. , 2004; Marcu et al. , 2006; Koehn et al. , 2003).",2
"Our interpretation is more useful than past interpretations involving marginal constraints (Kneser and Ney, 1995; Chen and Goodman, 1998) or maximum-entropy models (Goodman, 2004) as it can recover the exact formulation of interpolated Kneser-Ney, and actually produces superior results.",2
"While most parsing methods are currently supervised or semi-supervised (McClosky et al. 2006; Henderson 2004; Steedman et al. 2003), they depend on hand-annotated data which are difficult to come by and which exist only for a few languages.",2

"However, it seems unrealistic to expect a one-size-fits-all approach to be achieve uniformly high performance across varied languages, and, in fact, it doesnt. Though the system presented in (Dasgupta and Ng, 2007) outperforms the best systems in the 2006 PASCAL challenge for Turkish and Finnish, it still does significantly worse on these languages than English (F-scores of 66.2 and 66.5, compared to 79.4).",2
"They reported that their method is superior to BLEU (Papineni et al. , 2002) in terms of the correlation between human assessment and automatic evaluation.",2
"Unfortunately, this is not the case for such widely used MT evaluation metrics as BLEU (Papineni et al. , 2002) and NIST (Doddington, 2002).",2
"Although, there are various manual/automatic evaluation methods for these systems, e.g., BLEU (Papineni et al. 2002), these methods are basically incapable of dealing with an MTsystem and a w/p-MT-system at the same time, as they have different output forms.",2
"This restriction is necessary because the problem of optimizing many-to-many alignments 5 Our preliminary experiments with n-gram-based overlap measures, such as BLEU (Papineni et al. 2002) and ROUGE (Lin and Hovy 2003), show that these metrics do not correlate with human judgments on the fusion task, when tested against two reference outputs.",2
"This strategy is commonly used in MT evaluation, because of BLEUs well-known problems with documents of small size (Papineni et al. , 2002; Koehn, 2004).",2
"The most commonly used metric, BLEU, correlates well over large test sets with human judgments (Papineni et al. , 2002), but does not perform as well on sentence-level evaluation (Blatz et al. , 2003).",2
"Due to limited variations in the N-Best list, the nature of ranking, and more importantly, the non-differentiable objective functions used for MT (such as BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002)), one often found only local optimal solutions to , with no clue to walk out of the riddles.",2
"Automatic evaluation methods such as BLEU (Papineni et al. , 2002), RED (Akiba et al. , 2001), or the weighted N-gram model proposed here may be more consistent in judging quality as compared to human evaluators, but human judgments remain the only criteria for metaevaluating the automatic methods.",2
"METEOR was chosen since, unlike the more commonly used BLEU metric (Papineni et al. , 2002), it provides reasonably reliable scores for individual sentences.",2
"The ongoing evaluationliteratureisperhapsmostobviousinthe machine translation communitys efforts to better BLEU (Papineni et al. , 2002).",2
"By doing so we must emphasize that, as described in the previous section, the BLEU score was not designed to deliver satisfactory results at the sentence level (Papineni et al., 2002), and this also applies to the closely related NIST score.",2
"They are a bit controversial in a proper machine translation, where the popular BLEU score (Papineni et al. , 2002), although widely accepted as a measure of translation accuracy, seems to favor stochastic approaches based on 91 an n-gram model over other MT methods (see the results in (Nist, 2001)).",2
"Even the creators of BLEU point out that it may not correlate particularly well with human judgment at the sentence level (Papineni et al. , 2002), a problem also noted by (Och et al. , 2003) and (Russo-Lassner et al. , 2005).",2

"Presently, there exist methods for learning oppositional terms (Marcu and Echihabi, 2002) and paraphrase learning has been thoroughly studied, but successfully extending these techniques to learn incompatible phrases poses difficulties because of the data distribution.",2
"2 Previous work on Sentiment Analysis Some prior studies on sentiment analysis focused on the document-level classification of sentiment (Turney, 2002; Pang et al. , 2002) where a document is assumed to have only a single sentiment, thus these studies are not applicable to our goal.",2
"Point-wise mutual information (PMI) is commonly used for computing the association of two terms (e.g., Turney 2002), which is defined as: nullnullnull null null,null null nullnullnull nullnullnullnull,nullnull nullnull null null null nullnullnullnullnull . However, we argue that PMI is not a suitable measure for our purpose.",2

"Our focus is on the sentence level, unlike (Pang et al. , 2002) and (Turney, 2002); we employ a significantly larger set of seed words, and we explore as indicators of orientation words from syntactic classes other than adjectives (nouns, verbs, and adverbs).",2

"We will show that some achieve significantly better results than the standard minimum error rate training of (Och, 2003).",2
"The ubiquitous minimum error rate training (MERT) approach optimizes Viterbi predictions, but does not explicitly boost the aggregated posterior probability of desirable n-grams (Och, 2003).",2
"This method has the advantage that it is not limited to the model scaling factors as the method described in (Och, 2003).",2
"Unlike minimum error rate training (Och, 2003), our system is able to exploit large numbers of specific features in the same manner as static reranking systems (Shen et al. , 2004; Och et al. , 2004).",2

"The size of the development set used to generate 1 and 2 (1000 sentences) compensates the tendency of the unsmoothed MERT algorithm to overfit (Och, 2003) by providing a high ratio between number of variables and number of parameters to be estimated.",2
"Unfortunately, longer sentences (up to 100 tokens, rather than 40), longer phrases (up to 10 tokens, rather than 7), two LMs (rather than just one), higher-order LMs (order 7, rather than 3), multiple higher-order lexicalized re-ordering models (up to 3), etc. all contributed to increased system?s complexity, and, as a result, time limitations prevented us from performing minimum-error-rate training (MERT) (Och, 2003) for ucb3, ucb4 and ucb5.",2
"3.2 Evaluation Metrics AER (Alignment Error Rate) (Och and Ney, 2003) is the most widely used metric of alignment quality, but requires gold-standard alignments labelled with sure/possible annotations to compute; lacking such annotations, we can compute alignment fmeasure instead.",2
"While minimum error training (Och, 2003) has by now become a standard tool for interpolating a small number of aggregate scores, it is not well suited for learning in high-dimensional feature spaces.",2
"When compared to other kernel methods, our approach performs better than those based on the Tree kernel (Collins and Duffy, 2002; Collins and Roark, 2004), and is only 0.2% worse than the best results achieved by a kernel method for parsing (Shen et al. , 2003; Shen and Joshi, 2004).",2
"Although generating training examples in advance without a working parser (Turian & Melamed, 2005) is much faster than using inference (Collins & Roark, 2004; Henderson, 2004; Taskar et al. , 2004), our training time can probably be decreased further by choosing a parsing strategy with a lower branching factor.",2

"As one can see in Table 4, the resulting parser ranks among the best lexicalized parsers, beating those of Collins (1999) and Charniak and Johnson (2005).8 Its F1 performance is a 27% reduction in error over Matsuzaki et al.",2
"While the model of (Matsuzaki et al. , 2005) significantly outperforms the constrained model of (Prescher, 2005), they both are well below the state-of-the-art in constituent parsing.",2
"Although several methods have already been proposed to incorporate non-local features (Sutton and McCallum, 2004; Bunescu and Mooney, 2004; Finkel et al. , 2005; Roth and Yih, 2005; Krishnan and Manning, 2006; Nakagawa and Matsumoto, 2006), these present a problem that the types of non-local features are somewhat constrained.",2
"However, due to the lack of a fine grained NER tool at hand, we employ the Stanford NER package (Finkel et al., 2005) which identifies only four types of named entities.",2
"In a recent study by Finkel et al. , (2005), nonlocal information is encoded using an independence model, and the inference is performed by Gibbs sampling, which enables us to use a stateof-the-art factored model and carry out training efficiently, but inference still incurs a considerable computational cost.",2
"The simplicity of our approach makes it easy to incorporate dependencies across the whole corpus, which would be relatively much harder to incorporate in approaches like (Bunescu and Mooney, 2004) and (Finkel et al. , 2005).",2
"We also compare our performance against (Bunescu and Mooney, 2004) and (Finkel et al. , 2005) and find that we manage higher relative improvement than existing work despite starting from a very competitive baseline CRF.",2
"Although ITA rates and system performance both significantly improve with coarse-grained senses (Duffield et al., 2007; Navigli, 2006), the question about what level of granularity is needed remains.",2

"Sentence-level approximations to B exist (Lin and Och, 2004; Liang et al., 2006), but we found it most effective to perform B computations in the context of a setOof previously-translated sentences, following Watanabe et al.",2
"This latter point is a critical difference that contrasts to the major weakness of the work of (Liang et al. , 2006) which uses a top-N list of translations to select the maximum BLEU sentence as a target for training (so called local update).",2
"To our knowledge no systems directly address Problem 1, instead choosing to ignore the problem by using one or a small handful of reference derivations in an n-best list (Liang et al., 2006; Watanabe et al., 2007), or else making local independence assumptions which side-step the issue (Ittycheriah and Roukos, 2007; Tillmann and Zhang, 2007; Wellington et al., 2006).",2
"Both the global models (Liang et al., 2006; Watanabe et al., 2007) use fairly small training sets, and there is no evidence that their techniques will scale to larger data sets.",2
"Several studies have shown that large-margin methods can be adapted to the special complexities of the task (Liang et al., 2006; Tillmann and Zhang, 2006; Cowan et al., 2006) . However, the capacity of these algorithms to improve over state-of-the-art baselines is currently limited by their lack of robust dimensionality reduction.",2
"We have also illustrated that ASIA outperforms three other English systems (Kozareva et al., 2008; Pasca, 2007b; Snow et al., 2006), even though many of these use more input than just a semantic class name.",2
"We also compare ASIA on twelve additional benchmarks to the extended Wordnet 2.1 produced by Snow et al (Snow et al., 2006), and show that for these twelve sets, ASIA produces more than five times as many set instances with much higher precision (98% versus 70%).",2
"However, to what extent that assumption holds is tested only on a small number of language pairs using hand aligned data (Fox, 2002; Hwa et al. , 2002; Wellington et al. , 2006).",2
"This additional conditioning has the effect of making the choice of generation rules sensitive to the history of the generation process, and, we argue, provides a simpler, more uniform, general, intuitive and natural probabilistic generation model obviating the need for CFG-grammar transforms in the original proposal of (Cahill and van Genabith, 2006).",2
"In addition, uniform conditioning on mother grammatical function is more general than the case-phenomena specific generation grammar transform of (Cahill and van Genabith, 2006), in that it applies to each and every sub-part of a recursive input f-structure driving generation, making available relevant generation history (context) to guide local generation decisions.",2
"Even with the current incomplete set of semantic templates, the hypertagger brings realizer performance roughly up to state-of-the-art levels, as our overall test set BLEU score (0.6701) slightly exceeds that of Cahill and van Genabith (2006), though at a coverage of 96% insteadof98%.",2
"Our model improves the baseline provided by (Cahill and van Genabith, 2006): (i) accuracy is increased by creating a lexicalised PCFG grammar and enriching conditioning context with parent f-structure features; and (ii) coverage is increased by providing lexical smoothing and fuzzy matching techniques for rule smoothing.",2

"13Huang and Chiang (2007) give an informal example, but do not elaborate on it.",2
"Although various approaches to SMT system combination have been explored, including enhanced combination model structure (Rosti et al., 2007), better word alignment between translations (Ayan et al., 2008; He et al., 2008) and improved confusion network construction (Rosti et al., 2008), most previous work simply used the ensemble of SMT systems based on different models and paradigms at hand and did not tackle the issue of how to obtain the ensemble in a principled way.",2
"In contrast to existing approaches (Jayaraman and Lavie, 2005; Rosti et al., 2007), the context of the whole corpus rather than a single sentence is considered in this iterative, unsupervised procedure, yielding a more reliable alignment.",2
"2 Motivation and Prior Work While several authors have looked at the supervised adaptation case, there are less (and especially less successful) studies on semi-supervised domain adaptation (McClosky et al., 2006; Blitzer et al., 2006; Dredze et al., 2007).",2
"The combination is significantly better than (Shen et al., 2007) at a very high level, but more importantly, Shens results (currently representing the replicable state-of-the-art in POS tagging) have been significantly surpassed also by the semisupervised Morce (at the 99 % confidence level).",2
"In addition, the semi-supervised Morce performs (on single CPU and development data set) 77 times faster than the combination and 23 times faster than (Shen et al., 2007).",2
"Most recently, (Suzuki and Isozaki, 2008) published their Semi-supervised sequential labelling method, whose results on POS tagging seem to be optically better than (Shen et al., 2007), but no significance tests were given and the tool is not available for download, i.e. for repeating the results and significance testing.",2
"For comparison purposes, we revisit a fullygenerative Bayesian model for unsupervised coreference resolution recently introduced by Haghighi and Klein (2007), discuss its potential weaknesses and consequently propose three modifications to their model (Section 3).",2
Experimental results indicate that our model outperforms Haghighi and Kleins (2007) coreference model by a large margin on the ACE data sets and compares favorably to a modified version of their model.,2

12Poon and Domingos (2008) outperformed Haghighi and Klein (2007).,2
"Our system improves over the latent named-entity tagging in Haghighi and Klein (2007), from 61% to 87%.",2
"Secondly, while most pronoun resolution evaluations simply exclude non-referential pronouns, recent unsupervised approaches (Cherry and Bergsma, 2005; Haghighi and Klein, 2007) must deal with all pronouns in unrestricted text, and therefore need robust modules to automatically handle non-referential instances.",2
"Thirdly, (Shen et al., 2008) deploys the dependency language model to augment the lexical language model probability be1183 tween two head words but never seek a full dependency graph.",2
"This is in direct contrast to recent reported results in which other filtering strategies lead to degraded performance (Shen et al., 2008; Zollmann et al., 2008).",2
"This provides a compelling advantage over previous dependency language models for MT (Shen et al., 2008),whichusea5-gramLMonlyduringreranking.",2
"In comparison, the 2D model in Figure 2(c) used in previous work (Ding et al., 2008) can only model the interaction between adjacent questions.",2
"Our graphical representation has two advantages over previous work (Ding et al., 2008): unifying sentence relations and incorporating question interactions.",2
"Previous work (Ding et al., 2008) performs the extraction of contexts and answers in multiple passes of the thread (with each pass corresponding to one question), which cannot address the interactions well.",2
"In addition, the performance of the adapted model for Joint S&T obviously surpass that of (Jiang et al., 2008), which achieves an F1 of 93.41% for Joint S&T, although with more complicated models and features.",2
"Previous literature on GB parsing /Wehrli, 1984; Sharp, 1985; Kashket, 1986; Kuhns, 1986; Abney, 1986/has not addressed the issue of implementation of the Binding theory) The present paper intends in part to fill this gap.",2
"Formal complexity analysis has not been carried out, but my algorithm is simpler, at least conceptually, than the variable-word-order parsers of Johnson (1985), Kashket (1986), and Abramson and Dahl (1989).",2
"Although the parser is not yet complete, we expect that its breath of coverage of the language will be substantially larger than that of other Government-binding parsers recently reported in the literature (Kashket (1986), Kuhns (1986), Sharp (1985), and Wehrli (1984)).",2
"Among the applications of collocational analysis for lexical acquisition are: the derivation of syntactic disambiguation cues (Basili et al. 1991, 1993a; Hindle and Rooths 1991,1993; Sekine 1992) (Bogges et al. 1992), sense preference (Yarowski 1992), acquisition of selectional restrictions (Basili et al. 1992b, 1993b; Utsuro et al. 1993), lexical preference in generation (Smadjia 1991), word clustering (Pereira 1993; Hindle 1990; Basili et al. 1993c), etc. In the majority of these papers, even though the (precedent or subsequent) statistical processing reduces the number of accidental associations, very large corpora (10,000,000 words) are necessary to obtain reliable data on a ""large enough"" number of words.",2

"Regardless of whether it takes the form of dictionaries (Lesk 1986; Guthrie et al. 1991; Dagan, Itai, and Schwall 1991; Karov and Edelman 1996), thesauri (Yarowsky 1992; Walker and Amsler 1986), bilingual corpora (Brown et al. 1991; Church and Gale 1991), or hand-labeled training sets (Hearst 1991; Leacock, Towell, and Voorhees 1993; Niwa and Nitta 1994; Bruce and Wiebe 1994), providing information for sense definitions can be a considerable burden.",2
"Although previous work (Yarowsky, 1995; Blum and Mitchell, 1998; Abney, 2000; Zhang, 2004) has tackled the bootstrapping approach from both the theoretical and practical point of view, many key problems still remain unresolved, such as the selection of initial seed set.",2
"6 Conclusions In this paper, we showed that it is sometimes possible indeed, preferableto eliminate the initial bit of supervision in bootstrapping algorithms such as the Yarowsky (1995) algorithm for word sense disambiguation.",2
"Our experiments on the Canadian Hansards show that our unsupervised technique is significantly more effective than picking seeds by hand (Yarowsky, 1995), which in turn is known to rival supervised methods.",2
"Supervised approaches which make use of a small hand-labeled training set (Bruce and Wiebe, 1994; Yarowsky, 1993) typically outperform unsupervised approaches (Agirre et al. , 2000; Litkowski, 2000; Lin, 2000; Resnik, 1997; Yarowsky, 1992; Yarowsky, 1995), but tend to be tuned to a speci c corpus and are constrained by scarcity of labeled data.",2
"Unlike well-known bootstrapping approaches (Yarowsky, 1995), EM and CE have the possible advantage of maintaining posteriors over hidden labels (or structure) throughout learning; bootstrapping either chooses, for each example, a single label, or remains completely agnostic.",2
"Although a rich literature covers bootstrapping methods applied to natural language problems (Yarowsky, 1995; Riloff, 1996; Collins and Singer, 1999; Yangarber et al. , 2000; Yangarber, 2003; Abney, 2004) several questions remain unanswered when these methods are applied to syntactic or semantic pattern acquisition.",2
"However, our system is the unsupervised learning with small POS-tagged corpus,and we do not restrict the word's sense set within either binary senses(Yarowsky,1995; Karov, 1998) or dictionary's homograph level(Wilks, 1997).",2
"Bilexical context-free grammars have been presented in (Eisner and Satta, 1999) as an abstraction of language models that have been adopted in several recent real-world parsers, improving state-of-the-art parsing accuracy (A1shawl, 1996; Eisner, 1996; Charniak, 1997; Collins, 1997).",2
"These scores are higher than those of several other parsers (e.g. Collins 1997, 99; Charniak 1997), but remain behind tim scores of Charniak (2000) who obtains 90.1% LP and 90.1% LR for sentences _< 40 words.",2

"(1999) applied the parser of Collins (1997) developed for English, to Czech, and found thatthe performance wassubstantially lower when compared to the results for English.",2
"In particular, the model in Collins (1997) failed to generate punctuation, a deficiency of the model.",2
"Another consequence of not generating posthead conjunctions and punctuation as first-class words is that they 19 In fact, if punctuation occurs before the head, it is not generated at alla deficiency in the parsing model that appears to be a holdover from the deficient punctuation handling in the model of Collins (1997).",2
(2005) have implemented a dependency parser with good accuracy (it is almost as good at dependency parsing as Charniak (2000)) and very impressive speed (it is about ten times faster than Collins (1997) and four times faster than Charniak (2000)).,2
"Section 5 presents an error analysis for Collinss (1997) lexicalized model, which shows that the head-head dependencies used in this model fail to cope well with the flat structures in Negra.",2
"However, such constructions prove to be difficult for stochastic parsers (Collins et al. , 1999) and they either avoid tackling the problem (Charniak, 2000; Bod, 2003) or only deal with a subset of the problematic cases (Collins, 1997).",2
"In general, these authors have found that existing lexicalized parsing models for English (e.g. , Collins 1997) do not straightforwardly generalize to new languages; this typically manifests itself in a severe reduction in parsing performance compared to the results for English.",2
"This is well illustrated by the Collins parser (Collins, 1997; Collins, 1999), scrutinized by Bikel (2004), where several transformations are applied in order to improve the analysis of noun phrases, coordination and punctuation.",2
"The 75.4% results may seen low compared to parsing results like the 88% precision and recall in (Collins, 1997), but those parsing results include many easier-to-parse constructs.",2
"three models in (Collins, 1997) are susceptible to the O(n 3) method (cf.",2
"Statistical disambiguation such as (Collins and Brooks, 1995) for PP-attachment or (Collins, 1997; Charniak, 2000) for generative parsing greatly improve disambiguation, but as they model by imitation instead of by understanding, complete soundness has to remain elusive.",2
"2.3 Collinss (Bikels) Parser Collinss statistical parser (CBP; (Collins, 1997)), improved by Bikel (Bikel, 2004), is based on the probabilities between head-words in parse trees.",2
"While these approaches have had som e success to date (Collins, 1997; Charniak, 1997a), their usability as parsers in systems for natural language understanding is suspect.",2
"Methods like McDonalds, including the wellknown Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) algorithm (Goldstein et al., 2000), are subject to another problem: Summary-level redundancy is not always well modeled by pairwise sentence-level redundancy.",2
Our study also shows that the simulated-annealing algorithm (Kirkpatrick et al. 1983) is more effective 1552 than the perceptron algorithm (Collins 2002) for feature weight tuning.,2
"However, work in that direction has so far addressed only parse reranking (Collins and Duffy, 2002; Riezler et al. , 2002).",2
"The generalized perceptron proposed by Collins (2002) is closely related to CRFs, but the best CRF training methods seem to have a slight edge over the generalized perceptron.",2
"At any rate, regularized conditional loglinear models have not previously been applied to the problem of producing a high quality part-of-speech tagger: Ratnaparkhi (1996), Toutanova and Manning (2000), and Collins (2002) all present unregularized models.",2
"Whereas Ratnaparkhi (1996) used feature support cutoffs and early stopping to stop overfitting of the model, and Collins (2002) contends that including low support features harms a maximum entropy model, our results show that low support features are useful in a regularized maximum entropy model.",2
"Moreover, the parameters of the model must be estimated using averaged perceptron training (Collins, 2002), which can be unstable.",2
"Collins (2000) and Collins and Duffy (2002) rerank the top N parses from an existing generative parser, but this kind of approach 1Dynamic programming methods (Geman and Johnson, 2002; Lafferty et al. , 2001) can sometimes be used for both training and decoding, but this requires fairly strong restrictions on the features in the model.",2
"While both (Johnson, 2001) and (Klein and Manning, 2002) propose models which use the parameters of the generative model but train to optimize a discriminative criteria, neither proposes training algorithms which are computationally tractable enough to be used for broad coverage parsing.",2
"Although such approaches have been employed effectively (Pang et al. , 2002), there appears to remain considerable room for improvement.",2
"A number of studies have investigated sentiment classification at document level, e.g., (Pang et al. , 2002; Dave et al. , 2003), and at sentence level, e.g., (Hu and Liu, 2004; Kim and Hovy, 2004; Nigam and Hurst, 2005); however, the accuracy is still less than desirable.",2
"Despite relying on a the same concept, our approach outperforms BE in most comparisons, and it often achieves higher correlations with human judgments than the string-matching metric ROUGE (Lin, 2004).",2
"In what concerns the evaluation process, although ROUGE (Lin, 2004) is the most common evaluation metric for the automatic evaluation of summarization, since our approach might introduce in the summary information that it is not present in the original input source, we found that a human evaluation was more adequate to assess the relevance of that additional information.",2
"We considered a variety of tools like ROUGE (Lin, 2004) and METEOR (Lavie and Agarwal, 2007) but decided they were unsuitable for this task.",2
"Although evaluated on a different test set, our method also outperforms the correlation with human scores reported in Liu and Gildea (2005).",2
"Our method, extending this line of research with the use of labelled LFG dependencies, partial matching, and n-best parses, allows us to considerably outperform Liu and Gildea?s (2005) highest correlations with human judgement (they report 0.144 for the correlation with human fluency judgement, 0.202 for the correlation with human overall judgement), although it has to be kept in mind that such comparison is only tentative, as their correlation is calculated on a different test set.",2
"In Owczarzak (2008), the method achieves equal or higher correlations with human judgments than METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005), one of the best-performingautomaticMTevaluationmetrics.",2
"To analyze our methods on IV and OOV words, we use a detailed evaluation metric than Bakeoff 2006 (Levow, 2006) which includes Foov and Fiv.",2
"2 Motivation and Prior Work While several authors have looked at the supervised adaptation case, there are less (and especially less successful) studies on semi-supervised domain adaptation (McClosky et al., 2006; Blitzer et al., 2006; Dredze et al., 2007).",2
"While SCL has been successfully applied to PoS tagging and Sentiment Analysis (Blitzer et al., 2006; Blitzer et al., 2007), its effectiveness for parsing was rather unexplored.",2
"HMM-smoothing improves on the most closely related work, the Structural Correspondence Learning technique for domain adaptation (Blitzer et al., 2006), in experiments.",2
"Again the best result was obtained with IOB1 (F~=I =92.37) which is an imI)rovement of the best reported F,~=1 rate for this data set ((Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995): 92.03).",2
"This time the chunker achieved a F~=l score of 93.81 which is half a point better than the results obtained by (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995): 93.3 (other chunker rates for this data: accuracy: 98.04%; precision: 93.71%; recalh 93.90%).",2
"With all but two formats IBI-IG achieves better FZ=l rates than the best published result in (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995).",2
"Type Precision Recall Fa=l Overall 96.40 96.47 96.44 NP 96.49 96.99 96.74 VP 97.13 97.36 97.25 ADJP 89.92 88.15 89.03 ADVP 91.52 87.57 89.50 97.13 97.36 PP 97.25 Table 16: Results of 25-fold cross-validation chunking experiments with the merged context-dependent lexicon Tables 14 and 16 shows that our new chunk tagger greatly outperforms other reported chunk taggers on the same training data and test data by 2%-3%.(Buchholz S. , Veenstra J. and Daelmans W.(1999), Ramshaw L.A. and Marcus M.P.(1995), Daelemans W. , Buchholz S. and Veenstra J.(1999), and Veenstra J.(1999)).",2
"For the Penn Treebank, (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) reports an accuracy of 96.6% using the Maximum Entropy approach, our much simpler and therefore faster HMM approach delivers 96.7%.",2
"As the tagger of Ratnaparkhi (1996) cannot tag a word lattice, we cannot back off to this tagging.",2
"Though taggers based on dependency networks (Toutanova et al. , 2003), SVM (Gimenez and M`arquez, 2003), MaxEnt (Ratnaparkhi, 1996), CRF (Smith et al. , 2005), and other methods may reach slightly better results, their train/test cycle is orders of magnitude longer.",2
"A maximum entropy approach has been applied to partof-speech tagging before (Ratnaparkhi 1996), but the approach's ability to incorporate nonlocal and non-HMM-tagger-type evidence has not been fully explored.",2
"Ratnaparkhi (1996: 134) suggests use of an approximation summing over the training data, which does not sum over possible tags: "" h E f j = 2 P( ~)p(ti l hi)f j(hi,ti) i=1 However, we believe this passage is in error: such an estimate is ineffective in the iterative scaling algorithm.",2
One conclusion that we can draw is that at present the additional word features used in Ratnaparkhi (1996) looking at words more than one position away from the current do not appear to be helping the overall performance of the models.,2
"Some are the result of inconsistency in labeling in the training data (Ratnaparkhi 1996), which usually reflects a lack of linguistic clarity or determination of the correct part of speech in context.",2
"Both Charniak (2000) and Bikel (2004) were trained using the goldstandard tags, as this produced higher accuracy on the development set than using Ratnaparkhi (1996)s tags.",2
"For unknown words, SCL gives a relative reduction in error of 19.5% over Ratnaparkhi (1996), even with 40,000 sentences of source domain training data.",2

"This was a difcult challenge as many participants in the task failed to obtain any meaningful gains from unlabeled data (Dredze et al., 2007).",0
"Because their joint distributions have such closed-form expressions, the parameters can be estimated directly from the training data without the need for an iterative fitting procedure (as is required, for example, to estimate the parameters of maximum entropy models; (Berger et al. , 1996)).",0
"The data sets used are the standard data sets for this problem (Ramshaw and Maxcus, 1995; Argamon et al. , 1999; Mufioz et al. , 1999; Tjong Kim Sang and Veenstra, 1999) taken from the Wall Street Journal corpus in the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al. , 1993).",0
Freund and Schapire (1999) discuss how the theory for classification problems can be extended to deal with both of these questions; Collins (2002) describes how these results apply to NLP problems.,0
"These constraints tie words in such a way that the space of alignments cannot be enumerated as in IBM models 1 and 2 (Brown et al. , 1993).",0
"In our case, we computed a likelihood ratio score (Dunning, 1993) for all pairs of English tokens and Inuktitut substrings of length ranging from 3 to 10 characters.",0

"While early machine learning approaches for the task relied on local, discriminative classifiers (Soon et al., 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002b; Morton, 2000; Kehler et al., 2004), more recent approaches use joint and/or global models (McCallum and Wellner, 2004; Ng, 2004; Daume III and Marcu, 2005; Denis and Baldridge, 2007a).",0
"One of the theoretical problems with phrase based SMT models is that they can not effectively model the discontiguous translations and numerous attempts have been made on this issue (Simard et al., 2005; Quirk and Menezes, 2006; Wellington et al., 2006; Bod, 2007; Zhang et al., 2007).",0
"We have investigated this and our results are in line with (Koehn et al. , 2003) showing that the translation quality does not improve if we utilize phrases beyond a certain length.",0
"1 Introduction A recent theme in parsing research has been the application of statistical methods to linguistically motivated grammars, for example LFG (Kaplan et al. , 2004; Cahill et al. , 2004), HPSG (Toutanova et al. , 2002; Malouf and van Noord, 2004), TAG (Sarkar and Joshi, 2003) and CCG (Hockenmaier andSteedman,2002; ClarkandCurran,2004b).",0

"1 Introduction The rapid and steady progress in corpus-based machine translation (Nagao, 1981; Brown et al. , 1993) has been supported by large parallel corpora such as the Arabic-English and Chinese-English parallel corpora distributed by the Linguistic Data Consortium and the Europarl corpus (Koehn, 2005), which consists of 11 European languages.",0

1 Introduction The Inversion Transduction Grammar (ITG) of Wu (1997) is a syntactically motivated algorithm for producing word-level alignments of pairs of translationally equivalent sentences in two languages.,0
"They used the Bleu evaluation metric (Papineni et al. , 2002), but capped the n-gram precision at 4-grams.",0
"Unlike (Le Nguyen & Ho, 2004), one interesting idea proposed by (Barzilay & Lee, 2003) is to cluster similar pairs of paraphrases to apply multiplesequence alignment.",0
"In particular, we used this method with WordNet (Miller et al. , 1993) and using the same training data.",0
"When efficient techniques have been proposed (Brown et al. , 1993; Och and Ney, 2003), they have been mostly evaluated on safe pairs of languages where the notion of word is rather clear.",0
"Since (Hearst, 1992), numerous works have used patterns for discovery and identification of instances of semantic relationships (e.g., (Girju et al., 2006; Snow et al., 2006; Banko et al, 2007)).",0
"Incremental Sigmoid Belief Networks (Titov and Henderson, 2007) differ from simple dynamic SBNs in that they allow the model structure to depend on the output variable values.",0
"This text was part-of-speech tagged using the Xerox HMM tagger (Cutting et al. , 1992).",0
"To accommodate multiple overlapping features on observations, some other approaches view the sequence labeling problem as a sequence of classification problems, including support vector machines (SVMs) (Kudo & Matsumoto 2001) and a variety of other classifiers (Punyakanok & Roth 2001; Abney et al. 1999; Ratnaparkhi 1996).",0
"First, we extend the mechanism of adding gap variables for nodes dominating a site of discontinuity (Collins, 1997).",0
(1992) and Magerman (1994) used the clustering algorithm of Brown et al.,0
This model is very similar to the markovized rule models in Collins (1997).,0
"1 Introduction For statistical machine translation (SMT), phrasebased methods (Koehn et al. , 2003; Och and Ney, 2004) and syntax-based methods (Wu, 1997; Alshawi et al. 2000; Yamada and Knignt, 2001; Melamed, 2004; Chiang, 2005; Quick et al. , 2005; Mellebeek et al. , 2006) outperform word-based methods (Brown et al. , 1993).",0
"2.2.1 The evaluator The evaluator is a function p(t\[t', s) which assigns to each target-text unit t an estimate of its probability given a source text s and the tokens t' which precede t in the current translation of s. Our approach to modeling this distribution is based to a large extent on that of the IBM group (Brown et al. , 1993), but it diflhrs in one significant aspect: whereas the IBM model involves a ""noisy channel"" decomposition, we use a linear combination of separate predictions from a language model p(t\[t') and a translation model p(t\[s).",0
"Approaches include word substitution systems (Brown et al. , 1993), phrase substitution systems (Koehn et al. , 2003; Och and Ney, 2004), and synchronous context-free grammar systems (Wu and Wong, 1998; Chiang, 2005), all of which train on string pairs and seek to establish connections between source and target strings.",0
"One sees this clear trend in the supervised NLP literature examples include the Perceptron algorithm for tagging (Collins, 2002), MIRA for dependency parsing (McDonald et al., 2005), exponentiated gradient algorithms (Collins et al., 2008), stochastic gradient for constituency parsing (Finkel et al., 2008), just to name a few.",0
"Furthermore, recent studies revealed that word clustering is useful for semi-supervised learning in NLP (Miller et al., 2004; Li and McCallum, 2005; Kazama and Torisawa, 2008; Koo et al., 2008).",0
"7 Automated Sense Labelling of Discourse Connectives The focus here is on automated sense labelling of discourse connectives (Elwell and Baldridge, 2008; Marcu and Echihabi, 2002; Pitler et al., 2009; Wellner and Pustejovsky, 2007; Wellner, 679 Total Density of Intra-Sentential Intra-Sentential Total Intra-Sentential Intra-Sentential Subordinating Coordinating Discourse Genre Sentences Connectives Connectives/Sentence Conjunctions Conjunctions Adverbials ESSAYS 4774 1397 0.293 808 (57.8%) 438 (31.4%) 151 (10.8%) SUMMARIES 2118 275 0.130 166 (60.4%) 99 (36.0%) 10 (3.6%) LETTERS 739 200 0.271 126 (63.0%) 56 (28.0%) 18 (9.0%) NEWS 40095 9336 0.233 5514 (59.1%) 3015 (32.3%) 807 (8.6%) Figure 4: Distribution of Explicit Intra-Sentential Connectives.",0
"(Zhang et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2008)), a binarizable segmentation/permutation can be recognized by a binarized Synchronous Context-Free Grammar (SCFG), i.e., an SCFG in which the right hand sides of all non-lexical rules constitute binarizable permutations.",0
"Although to a lesser extent, measures of word relatedness have also been applied on other languages, including German (Zesch et al., 2007; Zesch et al., 2008; Mohammad et al., 2007), Chinese (Wang et al., 2008), Dutch (Heylen et al., 2008) and others.",0

"1 Introduction Most state-of-the-art wide-coverage parsers are based on the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993), making such parsers highly tuned to newspaper text.",0
"Our approach differs in important ways from the use of hidden Markov models (HMMs) for classbased language modeling (Jelinek et al. , 1992).",0
"Third, we hope that the improved parses of bitext will serve as higher quality training data for improving monolingual parsing using a process similar to self-training (McClosky et al., 2006).",0
The usefulness of likelihood ratios for collocation detection has been made explicit by Dunning (1993) and has been confirmed by an evaluation of various collocation detection methods carried out by Evert and Krenn (2001).,0
The algorithm is similar to the perceptron algorithm described in Collins (2002).,0
"While this heuristic estimator gives good empirical results, it does not seem to optimize any intuitively reasonable objective function of the (wordaligned) parallel corpus (see e.g., (DeNero et al., 2006)) The mounting number of efforts attacking this problem over the last few years (DeNero et al., 2006; Marcu and Wong, 2002; Birch et al., 2006; Moore and Quirk, 2007; Zhang et al., 2008) exhibits its difficulty.",0
"3.1 Translation Model Form We first assume the general hypergraph setting of Huang and Chiang (2007), namely, that derivations under our translation model form a hypergraph.",0
"(Turney (2002) makes a similar point, noting that for reviews, \the whole is not necessarily the sum of the parts"").",0
"This is analogous, and in a certain sense equivalent, to empirical risk minimization, which has been used successfully in related areas, such as speech recognition (Rahim and Lee, 1997), language modeling (Paciorek and Rosenfeld, 2000), and machine translation (Och, 2003).",0
"Model weights were trained separately for all 3 systems using minimum error rate training to maximize BLEU (Och, 2003) on the development set (dev).",0
"(Berger et al. , 1996)), 1We are overloading the word state to mean Arabic word position.",0
Standard data sets for machine learning approaches to this task were put forward by Ramshaw and Marcus (1995).,0
"Our technique is based on a novel Gibbs sampler that draws samples from the posterior distributionofaphrase-basedtranslationmodel(Koehn et al., 2003) but operates in linear time with respect to the number of input words (Section 2).",0
"3 Incremental Parsing Method Based on Adjoining Operation In order to avoid the problem of infinite local ambiguity, the previous works have adopted the following approaches: (1) a beam search strategy (Collins and Roark, 2004; Roark, 2001; Roark, 2004), (2) limiting the allowable chains to those actually observed in the treebank (Collins and Roark, 2004), and (3) transforming the parse trees with a selective left-corner transformation (Johnson and Roark, 2000) before inducing the allowable chains and allowable triples (Collins and Roark, 2004).",0
"The learning algorithm follows the global strategy introduced in (Collins, 2002) and adapted in (Carreras and M`arquez, 2004b) for partial parsing tasks.",0
"This second source of evidence is sometimes referred to as distributional similarity (Hindle, 1990).",0
"This idea of employing n-gram co-occurrence statistics to score the output of a computer system against one or more desired reference outputs has its roots in the BLEU metric for machine translation (Papineni et al. , 2002) and the ROUGE (Lin and Hovy, 2003) metric for summarization.",0

"We then replaced fi with its associated z-score k$,e. k$,e is the strength of code frequency f at Lt, and represents the standard deviation above the average of frequency fave,t. Referring to Smadja's definition (Smadja, 1993), the standard deviation at at Lt and strength kf,t of the code frequencies are defined as shown in formulas 1 and 2.",0
"Finally, we would like to investigate the incorporation of unsupervised methods for WSD, such as the heuristically-based methods of (Stetina and Nagao, 1997) and (Stetina et al. , 1998), and the theoretically purer bootstrapping method of (Yarowsky, 1995).",0

"1 Introduction Many state-of-the-art machine translation (MT) systems over the past few years (Och and Ney, 2002; Koehn et al., 2003; Chiang, 2007; Koehn et al., 2007; Li et al., 2009) rely on several models to evaluate the goodness of a given candidate translation in the target language.",0
"The production weights are estimated either by heuristic counting (Koehn et al., 2003) or using the EM algorithm.",0
"Statistical data about these various cooccurrence relations is employed for a variety of applications, such as speech recognition (Jelinek, 1990), language generation (Smadja and McKeown, 1990), lexicography (Church and Hanks, 1990), machine translation (Brown et al. , ; Sadler, 1989), information retrieval (Maarek and Smadja, 1989) and various disambiguation tasks (Dagan et al. , 1991; Hindle and Rooth, 1991; Grishman et al. , 1986; Dagan and Itai, 1990).",0
"Automated evaluation will utilize the standard DUC evaluation metric ROUGE (Lin, 2004) which representsrecallovervariousn-gramsstatisticsfrom asystem-generatedsummaryagainstasetofhumangenerated peer summaries.5 We compute ROUGE scores with and without stop words removed from peer and proposed summaries.",0
"(Black et al. , 1992; Materman, 1995)), we treat the word identities as a further refinement of the POS tags; thus we build a word classification tree for each POS tag.",0
"In fact, many studies that try to exploit Wikipedia as a knowledge source have recently emerged (Bunescu and Pasca, 2006; Toral and Munoz, 2006; Ruiz-Casado et al. , 2006; Ponzetto and Strube, 2006; Strube and Ponzetto, 2006; Zesch et al. , 2007).",0
"A key example is that of class-based language models (Brown et al. , 1992; Dagan et al. , 1999) where clustering approaches are used in order to partition words, determined to be similar, into sets.",0
"However, at the short term, the incorporation of these type of features will force us to either build a new decoder or extend an existing one, or to move to a new MT architecture, for instance, in the fashion of the architectures suggested by Tillmann and Zhang (2006) or Liang et al.",0
"Future work will include: (i) applying the method to retrieve other types of collocations (Smadja, 1993), and (ii) evaluating the method using Internet directories.",0
It also contains tools for tuning these models using minimum error rate training (Och 2003) and evaluating the resulting translations using the BLEU score (Papineni et al. 2002).,0
"2.3 Measuring the similarity between classes (step 3) In step 3, we measure the similarity between two primitive classes by using the method given by Hindle (Hindle, 1990).",0
"Most of them were developed for exhaustive parsing, i.e., producing all parse results that are given by the grammar (Matsumoto et al. , 1983; Maxwell and Kaplan, 1993; van Noord, 1997; Kiefer et al. , 1999; Malouf et al. , 2000; Torisawa et al. , 2000; Oepen et al. , 2002; Penn and Munteanu, 2003).",0
"We further assume that the degree of difficulty of a phrase is directly correlated with the quality of the translation produced by the MT system, which can be approximated using an automatic evaluation metric, such as BLEU (Papineni et al. , 2002).",0
"Finally, Zhang and Clark (2008) achieve an SF of 95.90% and a TF of 91.34% by 10-fold cross validation using CTB data.",0
"In the general language UPenn annotation efforts for the WSJ sections of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993), sentences are annotated with POS tags, parse trees, as well as discourse annotation from the Penn Discourse Treebank (Miltsakaki et al., 2008), while verbs and verb arguments are annotated with Propbank rolesets (Palmer et al., 2005).",0

2 Machine Translation using Inversion Transduction Grammar The Inversion Transduction Grammar (ITG) of Wu (1997) is a type of context-free grammar (CFG) for generating two languages synchronously.,0
"(p. 18) Whether this is a useful perspective for machine translation is debatable (Brown et al. 1993; Knoblock 1996)--however, it is a dead-on description of transliteration.",0
"The first, Powells method, was advocated by Och (2003) when MERT was first introduced for statistical machine translation.",0
"Since this trade-off is also affected by the settings of various pruning parameters, we compared decoding time and translation quality, as measured by BLEU score (Papineni et al, 2002), for the two models on our first test set over a broad range of settings for the decoder pruning parameters.",0
These include the bootstrapping approach [Yarowsky 1995] and the context clustering approach [Schutze 1998].,0
"Second, the significance of the K-S distance in case of the null hypothesis (data sets are drawn from same distribution) can be calculated (Press et al. , 1993).",0
"As with many domain adaptation problems, it is quite helpful to have some annotated target data, especially when annotation styles vary (Dredze et al., 2007).",0
"Indeed, the result of Collins (2002) that including low support features helps a voted perceptron model but harms a maximum entropy model is undone once the weights of the maximum entropy model are regularized.",0
"For comparison, we use the MT training program, GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003), the phrase-base decoder, Pharaoh (Koehn et al. , 2003), and the wordbased decoder, Rewrite (Germann, 2003).",0
"The probability distributions of these binary classifiers are learnt using maximum entropy model (Berger et al. , 1996; Haffner, 2006).",0
"We employ the phrase-based SMT framework (Koehn et al. , 2003), and use the Moses toolkit (Koehn et al. , 2007), and the SRILM language modelling toolkit (Stolcke, 2002), and evaluate our decoded translations using the BLEU measure (Papineni et al. , 2002), using a single reference translation.",0

"Collins (1997)s parser and its reimplementation and extension by Bikel (2002) have by now been applied to a variety of languages: English (Collins, 1999), Czech (Collins et al. , 1999), German (Dubey and Keller, 2003), Spanish (Cowan and Collins, 2005), French (Arun and Keller, 2005), Chinese (Bikel, 2002) and, according to Dan Bikels web page, Arabic.",0
"Hockenmaier et al (Hockenmaier et al. , 2000), although to some extent following the approach of Xia (Xia, 1999) where LTAGs are extracted, have pursued an alternative by extracting Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) (Steedman, 1993; Wood, 1993) lexicons from the Penn Treebank.",0
"(1991), Yarowsky (1995)).",0
"My guess is that the features used in e.g., the Collins (2003) or Charniak (2000) parsers are probably close to optimal for English Penn Treebank parsing (Marcus et al., 1993), but that other features might improve parsing of other languages or even other English genres.",0

"Pang et al. proposed a method of classifying movie reviews into positive and negative ones (Pang et al. , 2002).",0
"Assuming that the parameters P(etk|fsk) are known, the most likely alignment is computed by a simple dynamic-programming algorithm.1 Instead of using an Expectation-Maximization algorithm to estimate these parameters, as commonly done when performing word alignment (Brown et al., 1993; Och and Ney, 2003), we directly compute these parameters by relying on the information contained within the chunks.",0
"The basic model uses the following features, analogous to Pharaohs default feature set:  P( | ) and P( | )  the lexical weights Pw( | ) and Pw( | ) (Koehn et al. , 2003);1  a phrase penalty exp(1);  a word penalty exp(l), where l is the number of terminals in .",0

"So the sequence with a fork, which corresponds to only one nucleus is treated as a three word sequence in model C.

"Evidence have shown that by exploiting the constraint of so-called ""one sense per discourse,"" (Gale, Church and Yarowsky 1992b) and the strategy of bootstrapping (Yarowsky 1995), it is possible to boost coverage, while maintaining about the same level of precision.",0
"Afterwards, we select and remove a subset of highly informative sentences from U, and add those sentences together with their human-provided translations to L.

"We extracted all examples of each word from the 14-million-word English portion of the Hansards.8 Note that this is considerably smaller than Yarowskys (1995) corpus of 460 million words, so bootstrapping will not perform as well, and may be more sensitive to the choice of seed.",0
"It has been used for a variety of tasks, such as wide-coverage parsing (Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2002; Clark and Curran, 2007), sentence realization (White, 2006), learning semantic parsers (Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2007), dialog systems (Kruijff et al., 2007), grammar engineering (Beavers, 2004; Baldridge et al., 2007), and modeling syntactic priming (Reitter et al., 2006).",0

"While recent proposals for evaluation of MT systems have involved multi-parallel corpora (Thompson and Brew, 1996; Papineni et al. , 2002), statistical MT algorithms typically only use one-parallel data.",0

"Actually, now that SMT has reached some maturity, we see several attempts to integrate more structure into these systems, ranging from simple hierarchical alignment models (Wu 1997, Chiang 2005) to syntax-based statistical systems (Yamada and Knight 2001, Zollmann and Venugopal 2006).",0
"Features that consider only target-side syntax and words without considering s can be seen as syntactic language model features (Shen et al., 2008).",0
"2.1.2 Research on Syntax-Based SMT A number of researchers (Alshawi, 1996; Wu, 1997; Yamada and Knight, 2001; Gildea, 2003; Melamed, 2004; Graehl and Knight, 2004; Galley et al. , 2004) have proposed models where the translation process involves syntactic representations of the source and/or target languages.",0
"Yet, the very nature of these alignments, as defined in the IBM modeling approach (Brown et al. , 1993), lead to descriptions of the correspondences between sourcelanguage (SL) and target-language (TL) words of a translation that are often unsatisfactory, at least from a human perspective.",0
"Accurate measurement of semantic similarity between lexical units such as words or phrases is important for numerous tasks in natural language processing such as word sense disambiguation (Resnik, 1995), synonym extraction (Lin, 1998a), and automatic thesauri generation (Curran, 2002).",0
"We utilize a maximum entropy (ME) model (Berger et al., 1996) to design the basic classifier used in active learning for WSD.",0
"It is possible to recognize a common structure of these works, based on a typical bootstrap schema (Yarowsky, 1995; Collins and Singer, 1999): Step 1: Initial unsupervised categorization.",0
"Recently, there have been several discriminative approaches at training large parameter sets including (Tillmann and Zhang, 2006) and (Liang et al. , 2006).",0
"3.2 Maximum Entropy ME models implement the intuition that the best model will be the one that is consistent with the set of constrains imposed by the evidence, but otherwise is as uniform as possible (Berger et al. , 1996).",0
"Relative frequency ratio (RFR) of terms between two different corpora can also be used to discover domain-oriented multi-word terms that are characteristic of a corpus when compared with another (Damerau, 1993).",0
"A variety of methods have been applied, ranging from simple frequency (Justeson & Katz 1995), modified frequency measures such as c-values (Frantzi, Anadiou & Mima 2000, Maynard & Anadiou 2000) and standard statistical significance tests such as the t-test, the chi-squared test, and loglikelihood (Church and Hanks 1990, Dunning 1993), and information-based methods, e.g. pointwise mutual information (Church & Hanks 1990).",0
"In none of these cases did we repeat minimum-error-rate training; all these systems were trained using max-B. The metrics we tested were:  METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005), version 0.6,usingtheexact,Porter-stemmer,andWordNet synonmy stages, and the optimized parameters  = 0.81,  = 0.83,  = 0.28 as reported in (Lavie and Agarwal, 2007).",0
"ROUGE (Lin, 2004) is an evaluation metric designed to evaluate automatically generated summaries.",0
"We implement some global constraints and include unary constraints which were largely imported from the list of seed words used in (Haghighi and Klein, 2006).",0
"1 Introduction Robust statistical syntactic parsers, made possible by new statistical techniques (Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2000; Bikel, 2004) and by the availability of large, hand-annotated training corpora such as WSJ (Marcus et al. , 1993) and Switchboard (Godefrey et al. , 1992), have had a major impact on the field of natural language processing.",0
"So far, research in automatic opinion recognition has primarily addressed learning subjective language (Wiebe et al. , 2004; Riloff et al. , 2003), identifying opinionated documents (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003) and sentences (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003; Riloff et al. , 2003), and discriminating between positive and negative language (Pang et al. , 2002; Morinaga et al. , 2002; Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003; Turney and Littman, 2003; Dave et al. , 2003; Nasukawa and Yi, 2003; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005; Wilson et al. , 2005).",0
"(Gildea, 2003) and (Galley et al. , 2004) discuss different ways of generalizing the tree-level crosslinguistic correspondence relation, so it is not confined to single tree nodes, thereby avoiding a continuity assumption.",0
"Within NLP, applications include sentiment-analysis problems (Pang and Lee, 2004; Agarwal and Bhattacharyya, 2005; Thomas et al., 2006) and content selection for text generation (Barzilay and Lapata, 2005).",0
"5.2 Assigning complex ambiguity tags In the tagging literature (e.g. , Cutting et al (1992)) an ambiguity class is often composed of the set of every possible tag for a word.",0
"Under certain precise conditions, as described in (Abney, 2004), we can analyze Algorithm 1 as minimizing the entropy of the distribution over translations of U. However, this is true only when the functions Estimate, Score and Select have very prescribed definitions.",0
"In Table 6 we report our results, together with the state-of-the-art from the ACL wiki5 and the scores of Turney (2008) (PairClass) and from Amac Herdagdelens PairSpace system, that was trained on ukWaC.",0
"The second approximation proposed in (Titov and Henderson, 2007) takes into consideration the fact that, after each decision is made, all the preceding latent variables should have their means i updated.",0
"Therefore, P(g l e) is the sum of the probabilities of generating g from e over all possible alignments A, in which the position i in the target sentence g is aligned to the position ai in the source sentence e: P(gle) = I l m e ~, ~"" IT t(g# le=jla(a~ Ij, l,m)= al=0 amm0j=l m ! e 1""I ~ t(g# l e,)a(ilj, t, m) (3) j=l i=0 (Brown et al. , 1993) also described how to use the EM algorithm to estimate the parameters a(i I j,l, m) and $(g I e) in the aforementioned model.",0
"To model aspects of co-occurrence association that might be obscured by raw frequency, the log-likelihood ratio G2 (Dunning, 1993) was also used to transform the feature space.",0
"Most work on discriminative training for SMT has focussed on linear models, often with margin based algorithms (Liang et al., 2006; Watanabe et al., 2006), or rescaling a product of sub-models (Och, 2003; Ittycheriah and Roukos, 2007).",0
"Many stochastic parsing models use linguistic intuitions to find this minimal set, for example by restricting the statistical dependencies to the locality of headwords of constituents (Collins 1997, 1999; Eisner 1997), leaving it as an open question whether there exist important statistical dependencies that go beyond linguistically motivated dependencies.",0
"6.3 Unsupervised sentiment classification Turney proposed the unsupervised method for sentiment classification (Turney, 2002), and similar method is utilized by many other researchers (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003).",0
"We present two approaches to SMT-based query expansion, both of which are implemented in the framework of phrase-based SMT (Och and Ney, 2004; Koehn et al. , 2003).",0
"Pattern-based approaches are known for their high accuracy in recognizing instances of relations if the patterns are carefully chosen, either manually (Berland and Charniak, 1999; Kozareva et al., 2008) or via automatic bootstrapping (Hearst, 1992; Widdows and Dorow, 2002; Girju et al., 2003).",0
"Eisner (1996), Charniak (1997), Collins (1997), and many subsequent researchers1 annotated every node with lexical features passed up from its head child, in order to more precisely reflect the nodes inside contents.",0
"However, in the experiments described here, we focus on alignment at the level of sentences, this for a number of reasons: First, sentence alignments have so far proven their usefulness in a number of applications, e.g. bilingual lexicography (Langlois, 1996; Klavans and Tzoukermann, 1995; Dagan and Church, 1994), automatic translation verification (Macklovitch, 1995; Macklovitch, 1996) and the automatic acquisition of knowledge about translation (Brown et al. , 1993).",0
"The latter approach has become increasingly popular (e.g. Schabes et al. , 1993; Weischedel et al. , 1993; Briscoe, 1994; Magerman, 1995; Collins, 1996).",0
"Another application of hard clustering methods (in particular bottom-up variants) is that they can also produce a binary tree, which can be used for decision-tree based systems such as the SPATTER parser (Magerman, 1995) or the ATR Decision-Tree Part-OfSpeech Tagger (Black et al. , 1992, Ushioda, 1996).",0
The fact that different authors use different versions of the same gold standard to evaluate similar experiments (e.g. Goldwater & Griffiths (2007) versus Johnson (2007)) supports this claim.,0
"Additionally, we present results of the tagger on the NEGRA corpus (Brants et al. , 1999) and the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al. , 1993).",0

"The other approach is to estimate a single score or likelihood of a translation with rich features, for example, with the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) method as in (Carpuat and Wu, 2007; Ittycheriah and Roukos, 2007; He et al., 2008).",0

"1 Introduction Word compositions have long been a concern in lexicography(Benson et al. 1986; Miller et al. 1995), and now as a specific kind of lexical knowledge, it has been shown that they have an important role in many areas in natural language processing, e.g., parsing, generation, lexicon building, word sense disambiguation, and information retrieving, etc.(e.g. , Abney 1989, 1990; Benson et al. 1986; Yarowsky 1995; Church and Hanks 1989; Church, Gale, Hans, and Hindle 1989).",0

"The best result known to us is achieved by Toutanova[2002] by enriching the feature representation of the MaxEnt approach [Ratnaparkhi, 1996].",0
"Concept similarity is often measured by vectors of co-occurrence with context words that are typed with dependency information (Lin, 1998; Curran and Moens, 2002).",0
"Domain adaptation deals with these feature distribution changes (Blitzer et al., 2007; Jiang and Zhai, 2007).",0
"For instance, one might be interested in frequencies of co-occurences of a word with other words and phrases (collocations) (Smadja, 1993), or one might be interested in inducing wordclasses from the text by collecting frequencies of the left and right context words for a word in focus (Finch&Chater, 1993).",0
"Recently, Bean and Riloff (2004) presented an unsupervised approach to coreference resolution, which mined the co-referring NP pairs with similar predicatearguments from a large corpus using a bootstrapping method.",0
"Some approaches have used syntax at the core (Wu, 1997; Alshawi et al. , 2000; Yamada and Knight, 2001; Gildea, 2003; Eisner, 2003; Hearne and Way, 2003; Melamed, 2004) while others have integrated syntax into existing phrase-based frameworks (Xia and McCord, 2004; Chiang, 2005; Collins et al. , 2005; Quirk et al. , 2005).",0
"Meanwhile, translation grammars have grown in complexity from simple inversion transduction grammars (Wu, 1997) to general tree-to-string transducers (Galley et al., 2004) and have increased in size by including more synchronous tree fragments (Galley et al., 2006; Marcuetal.,2006; DeNeefeetal.,2007).",0
"The results have demonstrated the existence of priming effects in corpus data: they occur for specific syntactic constructions (Gries, 2005; Szmrecsanyi, 2005), consistent with the experimental literature, but also generalize to syntactic rules across the board, which repeated more often than expected by chance (Reitter et al. , 2006b; Dubey et al. , 2006).",0
"These features are calculated by mining the parse trees, and then could be used for resolution by using manually designed rules (Lappin and Leass, 1994; Kennedy and Boguraev, 1996; Mitkov, 1998), or using machine-learning methods (Aone and Bennett, 1995; Yang et al. , 2004; Luo and Zitouni, 2005).",0

"AL has already been applied to several NLP tasks, such as document classification (Schohn and Cohn, 2000), POS tagging (Engelson and Dagan, 1996), chunking (Ngai and Yarowsky, 2000), statistical parsing (Thompson et al. , 1999; Hwa, 2000), and information extraction (Lewis and Catlett, 1994; Thompson et al. , 1999).",0

"Moreover, the overall BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) and METEOR (Lavie and Agarwal, 2007) scores, as well as numbers of exact string matches (as measured against to the original sentences in the CCGbank) are higher for the hypertagger-seeded realizer than for the preexisting realizer.",0
"As such, discourse markers play an important role in the parsing of natural language discourse (Forbes et al. , 2001; Marcu, 2000), and their correspondence with discourse relations can be exploited for the unsupervised learning of discourse relations (Marcu and Echihabi, 2002).",0
"IBM constraints (Berger et al., 1996), lexical word reordering model (Tillmann, 2004), and inversion transduction grammar (ITG) constraints (Wu, 1995; Wu, 1997) belong to this type of approach.",0

The data set that has become standard for evaluation machine learning approaches is the one first used by Ramshaw and Marcus (1995).,0
Notice that most in-context and dictionary translations of source words are bounded within the same category in a typical thesaurus such as the LLOCE (McArthur 1992) and CILIN (Mei et al. 1993).,0
"Moreover, our approach integrates the abbreviation translation component into the baseline system in a natural way, and thus is able to make use of the minimum-error-rate training (Och, 2003) to automatically adjust the model parameters to reflect the change of the integrated system over the baseline system.",0

"Rather than learning how strings in one language map to strings in another, however, translation now involves learning how systematic patterns of errors in ESL learners English map to corresponding patterns in native English 2.2 A Noisy Channel Model of ESL Errors If ESL error correction is seen as a translation task, the task can be treated as an SMT problem using the noisy channel model of (Brown et al. , 1993): here the L2 sentence produced by the learner can be regarded as having been corrupted by noise in the form of interference from his or her L1 model and incomplete language models internalized during language learning.",0
"For a sequential learning algorithm, we make use of the Collins Perceptron Learner (Collins, 2002).",0
"For example, the words corruption and abuse are similar because both of them can be subjects of verbs like arouse, become, betray, cause, continue, cost, exist, force, go on, grow, have, increase, lead to, and persist, etc, and both of them can modify nouns like accusation, act, allegation, appearance, and case, etc. Many methods have been proposed to compute distributional similarity between words, e.g., (Hindle, 1990), (Pereira et al. 1993), (Grefenstette 1994) and (Lin 1998).",0

"Given a collection of facts, ME chooses a model consistent with all the facts, but otherwise as uniform as possible (Berger et al. , 1996).",0
"As with the graph-based parser, we use the discriminative perceptron (Collins, 2002) to train the transition-based model (see Figure 5).",0
"If the target CFG is purely binary branching, then the previous theoretical and linguistic analyses (Wu, 1997) suggest that much of the requisite constituent and word order transposition may be accommodated without change to the mirrored ITG.",0

"4Following Carletta (1996), we measure agreement in Kappa, which follows the formula K = P(A)P(E)1P(E) where P(A) is observed, and P(E) expected agreement.",0
"This fact, along with the observation that machine translation quality improves as the amount of monolingual training material increases, has lead to the introduction of randomised techniques for representing large LMs in small space (Talbot and Osborne, 2007; Talbot and Brants, 2008).",0
"This shows that hypothesis features are either not discriminative enough, or that the reranking model is too weak This performance gap can be mainly attributed to two problems: optimization error and modeling error (see Figure 1).1 Much work has focused on developing better algorithms to tackle the optimization problem (e.g. MERT (Och, 2003)), since MT evaluation metrics such as BLEU and PER are riddled with local minima and are difficult to differentiate with respect to re-ranker parameters.",0
"Secondly, we used the Kappa coefficient (Carletta, 1996), which has become the standard evaluation metric and the score obtained was 0.905.",0
"For the WMT 2009 Workshop, we selected a linear combination of BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) and TER (Snover et al., 2006) as optimization criterion,  := argmax{(2BLEU)TER}, based on previous experience (Mauser et al., 2008).",0
"The quality of the translation output is evaluated using BLEU (Papineni et al. , 2002).",0
"We develop this intuition into a technique called synchronous binarization (Zhang et al. , 2006) which binarizes a synchronous production or treetranduction rule on both source and target sides simultaneously.",0
"The classifier uses mutual information (MI) scores rather than the raw frequences of the occurring patterns (Church and Hanks, 1990).",0
"Moreover, as P-DOP is formulated as an enrichment of the treebank Probabilistic Context-free Grammar (PCFG), it allows for much easier comparison to alternative approaches to statistical parsing (Collins, 1997; Charniak, 1997; Johnson, 1998; Klein and Manning, 2003; Petrov et al. , 2006).",0

Note in passing that the ratio 1.04-1.08/99.7% compares very favourably with other systems; c.f. 3.0/99.3% by POST (Weischedel et al. 1993) and 1.04/97.6% or 1.09/98.6% by de Marcken (1990).,0
One example of the 450 latter problem is the following: in (Smadja 1993) the nature of a syntactic link between two associated words is detected a posteriori.,0
"For extracting simple noun phrases we first used Ramshaw and Marcuss base NP chunker (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995).",0
"(Wu, 1997)).",0
"It also shows that DOP's frontier lexicalization is a viable alternative to constituent lexicalization (as proposed in Charniak 1997; Collins 1997, 99; Eisner 1997).",0
"Our process of extraction of rules as synchronous trees and then converting them to synchronous CFG rules is most similar to that of (Galley et al., 2004).",0
"This approach gave an improvement of 2.7 in BLEU (Papineni et al. , 2002) score on the IWSLT05 Japanese to English evaluation corpus (improving the score from 52.4 to 55.1).",0
"2.5 Model Training We adapt the Minimum Error Rate Training (MERT) (Och, 2003) algorithm to estimate parameters for each member model in co-decoding.",0
"Although Phramer provides decoding functionality equivalent to Pharaohs, we preferred to use Pharaoh for this task because it is much faster than Phramer  between 2 and 15 times faster, depending on the configuration  and preliminary tests showed that there is no noticeable difference between the output of these two in terms of BLEU (Papineni et al. , 2002) score.",0
"Our baseline is the phrase-based MT system of (Koehn et al. , 2003).",0
"3 MaltParser MaltParser (Nivre et al., 2007b) is a languageindependent system for data-driven dependency parsing, based on a transition-based parsing model (McDonald and Nivre, 2007).",0
"Each i is a weight associated with feature i, and these weights are typically optimized using minimum error rate training (Och, 2003).",0
Word association norms based on co-occurrence information have been proposed by (Church and Hanks 1990).,0
"task, originally introduced in Ramshaw and Marcus (1995) and also described in (Collins, 2002; Sha and Pereira, 2003), brackets just base NP constituents5.",0
"Graph-based algorithms for classification into subjective/objective or positive/negative language units have been mostly used at the sentence and document level (Pang and Lee, 2004; Agarwal and Bhattacharyya, 2005; Thomas et al., 2006), instead of aiming at dictionary annotation as we do.",0
"A detailed discussion on the use of kappa in natural language processing is presented in (Carletta, 1996).",0
"ROUGE has been used in meeting summarization evaluation (Murray et al., 2005; Galley, 2006), yet the question remained whether ROUGE is a good metric for the meeting domain.",0
"(Collins 2002b) describes how the voted perceptron can be used to train maximum-entropy style taggers, and also gives a more thorough discussion of the theory behind the perceptron algorithm applied to ranking tasks.",0
"One is the longest common subsequence (LCS) based approach (Hori et al. , 2003; Lin, 2004a; Lin, 2004b; Lin and Och, 2004).",0
"We adopted the stop condition suggested in (Berger et al. , 1996) the maximization of the likelihood on a cross-validation set of samples which is unseen at the parameter estimation.",0
"The inclusion of phrases longer than three words in translation resources has been avoided, as it has been shown not to have a strong impact on translation performance [Koehn et al. , 2003].",0
"Since Soon (Soon et al., 2001) started the trend of using the machine learning approach by using a binary classifier in a pairwise manner for solving co-reference resolution problem, many machine learning-based systems have been built, using both supervised and, unsupervised learning methods (Haghighi and Klein, 2007).",0
"(Chanod and Tapanainen, 1995) compare two tagging frameworks for tagging French, one that is statistical, built upon the Xerox tagger (Cutting et al. , 1992), and another based on linguistic constraints only.",0
"The word alignments were created with Giza++ (Och and Ney, 2003) applied to a parallel corpus containing the complete Europarl training data, plus sets of 4,051 sentence pairs created by pairing the test sentences with the reference translations, and the test sentences paired with each of the system translations.",0
These are the same distributions that are needed by previous POS-based language models (Equation 5) and POS taggers (Church 1988; Charniak et al. 1993).,0
"(Cahill and van Genabith, 2006), and the third type is a mixture of the first and second type, employing n-gram and grammarbased features, e.g.",0
"We report case-insensitive scores for version 0.6 of METEOR (Lavie and Agarwal, 2007) with all modules enabled, version 1.04 of IBM-style BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), and version 5 of TER (Snover et al., 2006).",0
"We tuned the parameters of these features with Minimum Error Rate Training (MERT) (Och, 2003) on the NIST MT03 Evaluation data set (919 sentences), and then test the MT performance on NIST MT03 and MT05 Evaluation data (878 and 1082 sentences, respectively).",0
"Surprisingly, though, rather little work has been devoted to learning local syntactic patterns, mostly noun phrases (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995; Vilain and Day, 1996).",0
"Step 2 involves extracting minimal xRS rules (Galley et al. , 2004) from the set of string/tree/alignments triplets.",0
"The simplest (Wu, 1997) uses constit(np,3,5,np,4,8) to denote a NP spanning positions 35 in the English string that is aligned with an NP spanning positions 48 in the Chinese string.",0
"Chu-Carroll and Carpenter (1999) describe a method of disambiguation, where disambiguation questions are dynamically constructed on the basis of an analysis of the differences among the closest routing destination vectors.",0
"We would expect better performance with the more accurate approximation based on variational inference proposed and evaluated in (Titov and Henderson, 2007a).",0
"We do not consider mixed features between words and POS tags as in (l:tamshaw and Marcus, 1995), that is, a single feature consists of either words or tags.",0
"The algorithm to acquire the lexicon, implemented in the ARIOSTQLEX system, has been extensively described in \[Basili et al, 1993c\].",0
"Carletta mentions this problem, asking what the difference would be if the kappa statistic were computed across ""clause boundaries, transcribed word boundaries, and transcribed phoneme boundaries"" (Carletta, 1996, p. 252) rather than the sentence boundaries she suggested.",0
"On the British National Corpus (BNC), using Lins (1998) similarity method, we retrieve the following neighbors for the first and second sense, respectively: 1.",0
"Similar to BLEU score, we also use the similar Brevity Penalty BP (Papineni et al., 2002) to penalize the short translations in computing RAcc.",0
"In order to objectively evaluate our representation, we derived it from two different sources: constituency parse trees (generated with our implementation of (Collins, 1997)) and dependency parse trees (created using Minipar (Lin, 1998))1.",0
"As the third test set we selected all tokens of the Brown corpus part of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al. , 1993), a selected portion of the original one-million word Brown corpus (Kucera and Francis, 1967), a collection of samples of American English in many different genres, from sources printed in 1961; we refer to this test set as BROWN.",0
"Ramshaw and Marcus (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995) views chunking as a tagging problem.",0
"5 Related Work Although there have been many studies on collocation extraction and mining using only statistical approaches (Church and Hanks, 1990; Ikehara et al. , 1996), there has been much less work on collocation acquisition which takes into account the linguistic properties typically associated with collocations.",0
"Among various language modeling approaches, ngram modeling has been widely used in many applications, such as speech recognition, machine translation (Katz 1987; Jelinek 1989; Gale and Church 1990; Brown et al. 1992; Yang et al. 1996; Bai et al 1998; Zhou et al 1999; Rosenfeld 2000; Gao et al 2002).",0
"A total of 216 collocations were extracted, shown in Appendix A. We compared the collocations in Appendix A with the entries for the above 10 words in the NTC's English Idioms Dictionary (henceforth NTC-EID) (Spears and Kirkpatrick, 1993), which contains approximately 6000 definitions of idioms.",0
"For example, the coding manual for the Switchboard DAMSL dialogue act annotation scheme (Jurafsky, Shriberg, and Biasca 1997, page 2) states that kappa is used to assess labelling accuracy, and Di Eugenio and Glass (2004) relate reliability to the objectivity of decisions, whereas Carletta (1996) regards reliability as the degree to which we understand the judgments that annotators are asked to make.",0
"Each element in vectorw gives a weight to its corresponding element in (y), which is the count of a particular feature over the whole sentence y. We calculate the vectorw value by supervised learning, using the averaged perceptron algorithm (Collins, 2002), given in Figure 1.",0
"Berger et al. 1996 presented a way of computing conditional maximum entropy models directly by modifying equation 6 as follows (now instead of w we will explicitly use (x, y) ): i ~Cx~) = ~ f~(~, y) * ~(~, y) ~ ~ .~(~, y) * ~(~) * pCy I ~) = p(xk) (9) x6X yEY xEX yEY where ~(x, y) is an empirical probability of a joint configuration (w) of certain instantiated factor I variables with certain instantiated behavior variables.",0
"Collins (1997) reports 88% labeled precision and recall on individual parse constituents on data from the Penn Treebank, roughly consistent with our finding of at least 13% error.",0
"Automatic identification of subjective content often relies on word indicators, such as unigrams (Pang et al., 2002) or predetermined sentiment lexica (Wilson et al., 2005).",0
"Unlike previous annotations of sentiment or subjectivity (Wiebe et al. , 2005; Pang and Lee, 2004), which typically relied on binary 0/1 annotations, we decided to use a finer-grained scale, hence allowing the annotators to select different degrees of emotional load.",0
"Automatic methods for this often make use of lexicons of words tagged with positive and negative semantic orientation (Turney, 2002; Wilson et al., 2005; Pang and Lee, 2008).",0
"See Collins (2002a, 2002b) and Collins and Duffy (2001, 2002) for applications of the perceptron algorithm.",0
"A broad view of the possible scope of lexical semantics would thus be one which tries to chart out the systematic, generalizable aspects of word meanings, and of the relations between words, drawing on readily accessible sources of lexical knowledge, such as machine readable dictionaries, encyclopedias, and representative corpora, coupled with the kind of analytic apparatus that is needed to fruitfully explore such sources, for instance custom-built parsers to cope with dictionary definitions (Vossen 1990), statistical programs to deal with the distributional properties of lexical items in large corpora (Church & Hanks 1990) etc. At the same time this kind of massive data-acquisition should be made sensitive to the borders between perceptual experience, lexical knowledge and expert knowledge.",0
"Other metrics assess the impact of alignments externally, e.g., different alignments are tested by comparing the corresponding MT outputs using automated evaluation metrics (e.g. , BLEU (Papineni et al. , 2002) or METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005)).",0
"In addition, we use the measure from Resnik (1995), which is computed using an intrinsic information content measure relying on the hierarchical structure of the category tree (Seco et al. , 2004).",0
"Most stateof-the-art SMT systems treat grammatical elements in exactly the same way as content words, and rely on general-purpose phrasal translations and target language models to generate these elements (e.g. , Och and Ney, 2002; Koehn et al. , 2003; Quirk et al. , 2005; Chiang, 2005; Galley et al. , 2006).",0
"For example, the word alignment computed by GIZA++ and used as a basis to extract the TTS templates in most SSMT systems has been observed to be a problem for SSMT (DeNero and Klein, 2007; May and Knight, 2007), due to the fact that the word-based alignment models are not aware of the syntactic structure of the sentences and could produce many syntax-violating word alignments.",0
"Below is an example of the initial-state tagging of a sentence from the Penn Treebank \[Marcus et al. , 1993\], where an underscore is to be read as or.",0
"Dirichlet priors can be used to bias HMMs toward more skewed distributions (Goldwater and Griffiths, 2007; Johnson, 2007), which is especially useful in the weakly supervised setting consideredhere.",0
"For better probability estimation, the model was extended to work with (hidden) word classes (Brown et al. , 1992, Ward and Issar, 1996).",0
"Extensions to Hiero Several authors describe extensions to Hiero, to incorporate additional syntactic information (Zollmann and Venugopal, 2006; Zhang and Gildea, 2006; Shen et al., 2008; Marton and Resnik, 2008), or to combine it with discriminative latent models (Blunsom et al., 2008).",0
"As discussed in (Och, 2003), the direct translation model represents the probability of target sentence English e = e1eI being the translation for a source sentence French f = f1 fJ through an exponential, or log-linear model p(e|f) = exp( summationtextm k=1 k  hk(e,f))summationtext eprimeE exp( summationtextm k=1 k  hk(eprime,f)) (1) where e is a single candidate translation for f from the set of all English translations E,  is the parameter vector for the model, and each hk is a feature function of e and f. In practice, we restrict E to the set Gen(f) which is a set of highly likely translations discovered by a decoder (Vogel et al. , 2003).",0
"In related work (Chaovalit, 2005; Turney, 2002), both supervised and unsupervised approaches have been shown to have their pros and cons.",0

"2 Statistical Machine Translation We use a log-linear approach (Och, 2003) in which a foreign language sentence f is translated into another language, for example English, e, by seeking a maximum solution: e = argmax e wT h( f, e) (1) where h( f, e) is a large-dimension feature vector.",0

"(Bensch and Savitch, 1992; Brill, 1991; Brown et al. , 1992; Grefenstette, 1994; McKcown and Hatzivassiloglou, 1993; Pereira et al. , 1993; Schtltze, 1993)).",0
"4 Features For our experiments we use the features proposed, motivated and described in detail by (Nenkova and Louis, 2008).",0
As in most other statistical parsing systems we therefore use the pruning technique described in Goodman (1997) and Collins (1999: 263-264) which assigns a score to each item in the chart equal to the product of the inside probability of the item and its prior probability.,0
"For nonprojective parsing, the analogy to the inside algorithm is the O(n3) matrix-tree algorithm, which is dominated asymptotically by a matrix determinant (Smith and Smith, 2007; Koo et al. , 2007; McDonald and Satta, 2007).",0
"To find the optimal coefficients  for a loglinear combination of these experts, we use separate development data, using the following procedure due to Och (2003): 1.",0
"This is the shared task baseline system for the 2006 NAACL/HLT workshop on statistical machine translation (Koehn and Monz, 2006) and consists of the Pharaoh decoder (Koehn, 2004), SRILM (Stolcke, 2002), GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003), mkcls (Och, 1999), Carmel,1 and a phrase model training code.",0

"Yarowsky (1995) proposed such a method for word sense disambiguation, which we refer to as monolingual bootstrapping.",0
"Two LUs close in the space are likely to be in a paradigmatic relation, i.e. to be close in a is-a hierarchy (Budanitsky and Hirst, 2006; Lin, 1998; Pado, 2007).",0
"Apart from BLEU, a standard automatic measure METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005) was used for evaluation.",0
"Another alternative for future work is to compare the dynamic programming approach taken here with the beam-search approach of Collins and Roark (2004), which allows more global features.",0
"One approach here is that of Wu (1997), in which word-movement is modeled by rotations at unlabeled, binary-branching nodes.",0
"There have been many studies on POS guessing of unknown words (Mori and Nagao, 1996; Mikheev, 1997; Chen et al. , 1997; Nagata, 1999; Orphanos and Christodoulakis, 1999).",0
"More recently, there have been many proposals to introduce syntactic knowledge into SMT models (Wu, 1997; Alshawi et al. , 2000; Yamada and Knight, 2001; Lopez et al. , 2002).",0
"Instead, we opt to utilize the Stanford NER tagger (Finkel et al., 2005) over the sentences in a document and annotate each NP with the NER label assigned to that mention head.",0
"As our approach for incorporating unlabeled data, we basically follow the idea proposed in (Suzuki et al., 2007).",0
"As a common strategy, POS guessers examine the endings of unknown words (Cutting et al. 1992) along with their capitalization, or consider the distribution of unknown words over specific parts-of-speech (Weischedel et aL, 1993).",0
"Many methods for calculating the similarity have been proposed (Niessen et al. , 2000; Akiba et al. , 2001; Papineni et al. , 2002; NIST, 2002; Leusch et al. , 2003; Turian et al. , 2003; Babych and Hartley, 2004; Lin and Och, 2004; Banerjee and Lavie, 2005; Gimenez et al. , 2005).",0
"This is similar to work by several other groups which aims to induce semantic classes through syntactic co-occurrence analysis (Riloff and Jones, 1999; Pereira et al. , 1993; Dagan et al. , 1993; Hirschman et al. , 1975), although in .our case the contexts are limited to selected patterns, relevant to the scenario.",0

"This conclusion is supported by the fact that true IMT is not, to our knowledge, used in most modern translator's support environments, eg (Eurolang, 1995; I,'rederking et al. , 1993; IBM, 1995; Kugler et al. , 1991; Nirenburg, 1992; ~li'ados, 1995).",0
"The modifications are made to deal with the efficiency issue due to the fact that there is a very large number of features and training samples in our task, compared to only 8 features used in (Och 2003).",0
Supertags Part-of-speech disambiguation techniques (POS taggers) (Church 1988; Weischedel et al. 1993; Brill 1993) are often used prior to parsing to eliminate (or substantially reduce) the part-of-speech ambiguity.,0
