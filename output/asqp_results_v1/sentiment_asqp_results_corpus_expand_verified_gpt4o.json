This assumption is so dominant because current citation identification methods (Councill et al., 2008; Ritchie et al., 2008; Radev et al., 2009) can readily identify the citation sentence, whereas it is much harder to determine the relevant context. However, this assumption most certainly does not hold true when the citation context spans more than one sentence.",

This study purported to supplement the diet of 64 COPD patients with an omega-3 PUFA or an omega-6 PUFA supplement for two years, and reported significant improvements in the omega-3 PUFA group in the 6 min walk test, perceived rate of exertion (Borg score) and arterial oxygen saturation (pulse oximetry (SpO2)). The study also reported a decrease in sputum cytokines (inflammatory regulators) in the group receiving omega-3 PUFA with no change in the omega-6 PUFA group. The study concluded that “nutritional support with an omega-3 PUFA-rich diet is a safe and practical method for treating COPD” [6].
