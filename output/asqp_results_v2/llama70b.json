While such systems have been useful in limited contexts, they have also been criticized as cumbersome: by forcing users to conform to a particular formal system, they constrain communication and make it less natural (Schoop, 2001)",

The study also reported a decrease in sputum cytokines (inflammatory regulators) in the group receiving omega-3 PUFA with no change in the omega-6 PUFA group. The study concluded that “nutritional support with an omega-3 PUFA-rich diet is a safe and practical method for treating COPD” [6].
