This study purported to supplement the diet of 64 COPD patients with an omega-3 PUFA or an omega-6 PUFA supplement for two years, and reported significant improvements in the omega-3 PUFA group in the 6 min walk test, perceived rate of exertion (Borg score) and arterial oxygen saturation (pulse oximetry (SpO2)). The study also reported a decrease in sputum cytokines (inflammatory regulators) in the group receiving omega-3 PUFA with no change in the omega-6 PUFA group. The study concluded that “nutritional support with an omega-3 PUFA-rich diet is a safe and practical method for treating COPD” [6]. This paper was retracted by the journal in 2008 [7], following an institutional investigation that found data had been falsified by the lead author.",

        "text": "The literature boom in the life sciences over the past few years has sparked increasing interest into text mining tools, which facilitate the automatic extraction of useful knowledge from text (Ananiadou et al., 2006; Ananiadou & McNaught, 2006; Zweigenbaum et al., 2007; Cohen & Hunter, 2008). Most of these tools have focussed on entity recognition and relation extraction and with few exceptions, e.g., (Hyland, 1996; Light et al., 2004; Sandor, 2007; Vincze et al., 2008), do not take into account the discourse context of the knowledge extracted. However, failure to take this context into account results in the loss of information vital for the correct interpretation of extracted knowledge,",
