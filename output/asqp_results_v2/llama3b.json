This has been a very successful approach, but recent algorithms for eliminating subsets of readings have pushed the expressive power of these formalisms to their limits; for instance, Koller and Thater (2006) speculate that further improvements over their (incomplete) redundancy elimination algorithm require a more expressive formalism than dominance graphs.",

The study also reported a decrease in sputum cytokines (inflammatory regulators) in the group receiving omega-3 PUFA with no change in the omega-6 PUFA group.
